<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This book, important in subject and scientific in method, appears under
religious auspices for a very definite reason. The Educational Committee
of the Federal Council of Churches has sought to find concrete
expression for those Christian principles which are too often confined
to abstract statement. Christian ethics are well understood in theory.
There is need now for a science of Christian conduct through which we
may realize ethical ideals in our working life.</p>

<p>Because of its basic character and its present importance in the public
mind the coal industry offers a field for this endeavor. Hence the
Educational Committee presents through the medium of the Press of the
Young Men's Christian Association, this book, addressed particularly to
the people of the churches of America.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Challenge of Power</span></h3>

<p>Scientists tell us that the energy poured by the sun on the Desert of
Sahara in a single day exceeds by fourfold the energy stored in the
annual production of all the coal fields in the world. They dream of a
time when the radiant energy of the sun will be captured and turned to
the uses of man. Then the wheels of our myriad machines will spin with
the sun and the stars. In the soft whirr of their motors men will hear
the music of the spheres.</p>

<p>When that time comes, will it signal the triumph of man's will over
nature, the end of the brute struggle with hunger? Will it find our
ideals of cooperation, service, and brotherhood ripe for practical
application? Or will it mark a new intensification of the exploitation
of man by men, of the clash of groups for power, of international wars
for possession? Shall we have the spiritual capacity to match our
technical achievement? Shall we know what we mean when we pray Thy
Kingdom Come on Earth as IT IS in Heaven?</p>

<p>That prayer was old on the lips of men when a comparable gift was
discovered. During ages without number the shifting seas and the
slow-moving mountains had pressed down the sun's vintage in the coal
beds of the earth. Less than two centuries ago the steam engine
harnessed coal to the looms of England. With coal came iron and steel,
and with steel and steam came the industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> revolution, its factories
massed in cities, its railroads weaving manufacturing centers together,
its steel ships and cables and telegraph wires unfolding and integrating
the economic life of the world. In western Europe especially it
converted an age-long economic deficit into an economic surplus. For the
first time in human history it brought the possibility of the good life
to every man's door. But it found men spiritually unprepared. The
ancient bread hunger was still upon them. As in the tribal days men
warred upon one another for food, so now they warred upon one another
for coal and the incredible spawn of coal. For coal means food,
clothing, houses, ships, railroads, newspapers, chemicals, and guns.
With the coming of coal and coal-driven machinery the earth and the
fullness thereof was unlocked for the service of man. There was not only
the possibility of the good life for each but also of a noble,
well-ordered civilization for all. But instead of establishing
civilization on foundations of mutual aid, service, and brotherhood, men
turned their cities into shambles of childhood, poverty was embittered,
civil strife in mine, mill, and factory became endemic, wars on an
unprecedented scale engaged nations and groups of nations. The World War
and the famine and widespread desolation that followed gave tragic
evidence of our spiritual unpreparedness.</p>

<p>Yet it would be as falsely sentimental to set up a golden
age as a heightening background for the evils that came
with coal as it would be to ignore or gloze over those evils.
Economic insecurity, poverty, disease, wars, and blighted
childhood are as old as human existence. The world is a
better, richer, more vibrant, and thrilling abode since coal
came than it was before. The indictment of our coal age
can be justly based, not upon what it has destroyed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
rather upon what it has missed,&mdash;upon its spiritually
blind, its bungling and inadequate use of a gift more
magnificent than any allotted to man since grain was first
sown to the harvest and ground at a mill. An indictment
that involves all mankind is hardly an indictment at all.
It is rather a confession of our common human limitations,
a recognition of the tragic circumstances of our
spiritual growth. It will be answered when we as individuals
and nations and groups of nations, set ourselves to
turn the wisdom of experience to account in building a
civilization worthy of a world that moves through infinite
space with the sun and the marching stars.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Coming of Coal</span></h3>

<p>The making of all the coal in the earth began when the
sun hurled the earth into its orbit. Before there were
vertebrates in the sea, or animals, or plants of any kind on
land&mdash;fully one hundred and fifty million years ago&mdash;low
foldings and depressions appeared on the earth where the
Appalachian Mountains now are. Following the lines of
what has become the Atlantic, vast ridges appeared. Ages
later swamp forests grew in the intervening valleys, bearing
and shedding the spores and thick, somber leaves still
traceable in the lower carboniferous strata. In that time,
a shallow sea covered what is now the Mississippi Valley
in whose sludgy shoals more swamp forests grew. Along
the inland seas and ocean beaches of Europe and Asia, the
tides, the winds, and rains slowly spread the clay for still
other swamp forests. When the lush plant life of the
carboniferous age came out of the marshy ooze, it spread
along the edges of the land, crept up the long estuaries
between the rising and sinking hills and on into the landlocked
seas. The rocks beneath and about these carboniferous
forests rose and sank age through age, cycle through
cycle. When they sank slowly, tangled morasses formed;
when they sank rapidly, the inrushing water killed the
plants and buried them under a covering of silt. When
the rocky strata rose again, the swamp forests crept back
to their old places, and again bore and shed their fernlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
leaves, their spores and great scarred trunks upon the
oozy bottom now scores or hundreds of feet above the
level on which their ancestors had stood ages before.</p>

<p>Then, some seventy million years ago, a geographical
revolution convulsed what is now northeastern America.
The great trough running parallel to the Atlantic, where
swamp forests had grown and died and grown again,
gave way under the ever-increasing load. The ridges at
its sides pressed in upon it, crumpled it into giant folds,
broke it, pushed its shattered edges out in mighty over-thrusts,
released molten rock to flow up and over its torn
surface. The whole titanic mass was racked and twisted
with pressure and heat until what had been a slowly subsiding
sea-bottom, covered with decaying swamp vegetation,
rose on the shoulders of the newborn Appalachian
Mountains, then a lofty range of clean, stark peaks
stretching from Newfoundland to Arkansas,&mdash;two thousand
miles.</p>

<p>And with this great geographical revolution, the work
of making coal in eastern North America was finished.
From the softest bituminous to the hardest anthracite,
that work was done.</p>

<p>But in other parts of the world, the dense carboniferous
forests continued to grow for another fifty or more million
years. In the shallows of the Mississippi Valley, on
the shores of the island that is now Colorado, the coal
plants grew and died with the seasonal march of the sun.
In parts of Europe, Russia, and China, coal continued to
form.</p>

<p>And then came another geographical revolution, some
twenty million years ago, that raised up the Rockies and
the Andes along the western border of the Americas, tore
and twisted and upturned the rocks of Europe and Asia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
until with the exception of a few odd pockets where small
swamp forests lived on for a time, the coal making of the
whole earth was ended.</p>

<p>Twenty million years ago, all the coal we have or shall
have had been packed away beneath the ribs of the earth,
in seams varying in height from sixty feet to the thickness
of a blade of grass. In many places the flat layers in
which it was first deposited had been thrown into overlapping
folds. Some of it had been subjected to comparatively
little heat and to the pressure only of the rocky
strata above it; this is the bituminous, which is still rich
in oils, gas, tar&mdash;unreleased volatile matter. Some had
been crushed by the weight of uplifted mountains,
roasted, fused, and burned by molten lava and volcanic
flame; this is anthracite, which is almost pure carbon and
ash. Some had been exposed to greater pressure still, to
intenser heat; this is graphite, which can no longer be
burned at all.</p>

<p>The distribution of coal in the world by quality and
quantity has been, next to climate and the fertility of the
soil, the physical fact of most decisive importance in the
history of modern civilization. For countless ages coal
lay practically unused in the earth. Then, sometime between
1750 and 1760, an intricate interlocking of circumstances
set coal to rule the world, not through new discoveries
of coal itself but rather through improvements in
spinning and weaving machinery which made possible the
massing of large numbers of spinners and weavers for
large-scale production if power could be found to drive
the new machines for them. The steam engine had
already been invented, but it was still a tentative thing,
a primitive type, wondered at and experimented with.
Coal had been used, but only in a few favored spots where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it cropped out on the earth's surface, or was washed
ashore by the sea, and then only as a domestic fuel. It
was at the call of the master weavers and spinners of
England that the steam engine was set to run the machines;
then to furnish a blast so that coal might be used
to cheapen the smelting of iron and steel so that more
machines might be made; then to pump out the deepening
mines so that more and more power to keep the machines
running might be won. Steam raising was coal's first
great play for power and it is the work through which it
still holds its industrial supremacy. Between 1800 and
1900 coal-driven engines multiplied until by the end of
the century they were producing energy equivalent to
seventy million horse-power; during the first twenty years
of the twentieth century, their power-producing capacity
more than doubled. So coal wrought the industrial revolution,
the greatest revolution in all human history, which
transformed social and economic life as radically as the
geographical revolution transformed the earth's surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It introduced a new race of men,&rdquo; writes H. de B.
Gibbins, &ldquo;men who work with machinery instead of with
their hands, who cluster together in cities instead of
spreading over the land, men who trade with those of
other nations as readily as with those of their own town,
men whose workshops are moved by the great forces of
nature and whose market is no longer the city or country
but the world itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Measured by the crude standards of gross wealth and
numbers, the people of the earth have flourished mightily
since the dominion of coal began. The aggregate wealth
of the world has increased to fabulous proportions. The
average expectation of life among Western peoples has
doubled. Between 1800 and 1910 the world's population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
rose from approximately 640,000,000 to 1,616,000,000.
The population of England, which had increased only
fifteen per cent from 1651 to 1751, increased two hundred
per cent during the next century. Between 1816 and
1910, the population of France increased fifty per cent,
of Germany three hundred per cent, of the United States
seventeen hundred per cent.</p>

<p>Moreover the drive of coal's energy immensely stimulated
men's inventive faculties. It transformed Kay's
&ldquo;flying shuttle&rdquo; and Hargreaves' &ldquo;spinning jenny&rdquo; from
clever toys into instruments of large-scale production, the
crude steam engines of Newcomen and Watt into the
great modern locomotive and the turbine engine; it made
possible the large-scale production of telegraph wires and
ocean cables, the cylinder press and typesetting machines,
the electrical dynamo, the internal-combustion engine, the
aeroplane, and even the space-ranging modern telescope.
It lifted the veil from the seven seas, broke down the
physical barriers between the peoples of the earth, forged
the steel framework of national and international government.
The commercial and political primacy which England
held for more than one hundred and fifty years
rested upon her abundant fields of easily accessible coal.
The cosmic energy flowing out from her mines spread her
trade and her surplus population to the four corners of the
earth and made her triumphant over Spain and Holland&mdash;nations
poor in coal. The coal of Westphalia, associated
with the iron ores of Lorraine, welded the States of Germany
into the empire of the latter nineteenth century and
hurled her green-grey armies across her frontiers in the
mad adventure of 1914. The vast, rich coal fields of
North America have transformed the United States from
an agricultural appanage of Europe into the foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
manufacturing and commercial nation in the world. The
future of Russia lies largely in the coal fields of the
Donetz basin. The imperfectly surveyed coal and ore
fields of China and Siberia are probably the strongest of
the magnets drawing the Powers into the problem of the
Pacific. Coal and the continuing industrial revolution
are still shaping the destiny of mankind.</p>

<p>But in the history of the human race the fact of transcending
significance is the presence in man of instincts,
emotions, mind, reason, will, conscious hunger, and conscious
love of one's neighbor,&mdash;all the constituents of that
personality of supreme worth whose ceaseless struggle
for mastery over the forces of nature, for escape from
hunger, want, and war into a world of plenty, beauty,
mutual aid, and service is the epic of civilization. The
value of coal, as of all material things, finds its true measure
not in numbers or horse-power units, but in its effect
upon the soul of man, the fullness of opportunity enjoyed
by each individual for self-realization and service, the
progress of the race toward brotherhood. The ultimate
appraisal of the coal age will be determined by the issue
of the struggle between bread hunger and love in the soul
of man&mdash;the struggle between his acquisitive instinct and
his growing consciousness of kind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Drama of Civilization</span></h3>

<p>Coal embodies our chance of a world civilization. It
is the material form in which the possibility of peace and
ease, beauty and learning, cooperation and brotherhood,
have come to the human race.</p>

<p>Before coal was harnessed to the looms of England,
before the stored energy of the sun replaced hand labor
at the wheels and gears of her newly invented machines,
there was no such thing as a world civilization. There
was indeed nothing to base a world civilization upon, for
civilization implies leisure consciously to cooperate with
other people, to make life not merely endurable but beautiful
and pleasant as well, leisure to subordinate the
instinct to acquire to the instinct to enjoy, the acquisitive
instinct to the consciousness of kind&mdash;and the race as a
whole had its entire attention focussed on the effort to get
enough food and clothing and shelter so that it would
live and not die. For only as the acquisitive instinct was
dominant and successful could men survive either singly
or in groups, before the coming of coal.</p>

<p>The limits of civilization were primarily the mechanical
limitations of man's ability to produce. So long as his
only ways to drive machinery were by wind and water,
the strength of domesticated animals, and his own brawn,
it was almost impossible for him to accumulate sufficient
reserves of food and clothing so that instead of thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
what he should eat and what he should put on, he could
think a little of how to make life good. And whenever by
some fortunate chance a group of men did get together a
small hoard, parallel with the growth of each tiny surplus
grew the hatred of the outside groups who wished to
possess it, and the need to defend it by force. So that
when here and there through the centuries pocketed
civilizations did arise, they were civilizations perpetually
armed for defence and with the sword in their hands.
And though the spirit of man in such places as India and
Egypt, in China, Persia, Palestine, Greece, Carthage,
Rome, and the free Italian cities, as soon as the pressure
was removed ever so little, did flower into religion and art
and science, these favored oases were surrounded by
crowding, hungry multitudes who pressed in and in till
at last every one of these was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Before the coming of coal man had to satisfy his longing
for peace and knowledge and companionship through
his dreams. These have come down to us in the legends
of India and Israel, China, Greece, and our own Nordic
ancestors which perpetually play about the fabulous treasure&mdash;the
Golden Fleece, the land of milk and honey, the
Volsung's miraculous hoard&mdash;pathetic symbols of plenty,
liberation, and the possibility of brotherhood. But until
coal came there was no way to make these dreams come
true. For survival was only to the strong, or to the cunning,
or to those who were willing to grow fat on the
leanness of others, and every respite from the basic business
of keeping alive was extravagantly paid for either
by oneself or another&mdash;before coal came.</p>

<p>But with the coming of coal there rose the possibility of
producing more than enough to keep everybody alive. A
tireless bond servant had been given to the race whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
power grew as it was called on, until now in the United
States where coal is used most indefatigably, each family
has the equivalent of thirty human servants, whose use
does not need to involve the exploitation of man by man.
For the first time there is the possibility of all having
enough,&mdash;of a world surplus on which to base civilization.</p>

<p>It was too much to expect that this possibility should be
understood by a race which had never before got further
than to see that if their family, their town, their nation,
was to have ease and plenty, it must be quick to get as
much of the world's store of food and goods as it could,&mdash;and
to acquire them in spite of the fact that the other
groups, who were hot after them also, might perish if they
did not get their share. They did not see that with the
coming of coal the supply was practically unlimited, and
so it was not man's sense of brotherhood but his acquisitive
instinct, checked and balked for ages, that first found
channels of release when coal came.</p>

<p>After the coming of coal this acquisitive instinct expanded
with cosmic force. For the first time in history,
men and nations thrilled with the manifest possibility of
their escape from the ancient menace of hunger into a
world of measureless plenty. In their greedy rush for
possession, men within nations trampled one another
under foot, and nations girded themselves for world
dominion. And as wealth flowed into the village, the
town, and the nation, all men exulted, those who themselves
had nothing as well as those who grew rich. For
famine still hovered beyond the horizon, and the very
presence in the community of an economic surplus, by
whomever owned, gave all men a sense of security as
though at last they had won the miraculous hoard of
their dreams, through the coming of coal.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that in this cumulative drive of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
acquisitive instinct with the long-sought surplus almost in
sight, the attitude of mind established and glorified during
the ages when war was the common alternative to hunger,
should carry over into factories and mines. The methods
of war,&mdash;the ruthless sacrifice of part of the community
for the benefit of the rest,&mdash;were the only methods men
understood. The new possibility had arrived but the old
habit of mind remained. With the coming of coal and
the beginning of the industrial revolution, no one dreamed
that the time for the cessation of human sacrifice had
arrived. When the mines were first opened, the slave
trade still flourished with almost universal sanction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a slight fact,&rdquo; wrote Lecky, &ldquo;but full of ghastly
significance as illustrating the state of feeling at the time,
that the ship in which Hawkins sailed on his second expedition
to open the English slave trade was called <i>The
Jesus</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This voyage was made a hundred years before the harnessing
of coal, but in the middle of the eighteenth century
and far into the nineteenth much the same state of
feeling widely prevailed. The first miners in Scotland
were serfs; the first miners in northern England were
bondsmen who sold themselves by the year and were
forbidden by law to leave the mine to which they were
bound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; write J. L. and Barbara Hammond,
basing their account on the report of the Parliamentary
Committee on the Employment of Children and Young
Persons (1842), &ldquo;boys were employed everywhere, girls
in certain districts, Lancashire, Cheshire, the West Riding,
and South Wales, besides Scotland. Children were
employed as trappers, that is to open and shut the doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that guided the draught of air through the mine; as
fillers, that is to fill the skips and carriages when the men
have hewn the coal; and as pushers, or hurriers, that is,
to push the trucks along from the workers to the foot of
the shaft. But in some mines these trucks were drawn
instead of being pushed. &lsquo;A girdle is put round the
naked waist, to which a chain from the carriage is hooked
and passed between the legs, and the boys crawl on their
hands and knees, drawing the carriage after them.&rsquo; In
the early days of the century this arrangement was very
common, and women and girls were so employed. By
1842 it was more usual to have small iron railways, and
the carriages were pushed along them. The trapping was
done everywhere by children, generally from five to eight
years of age. A girl of eight years old described her day:
&lsquo;I'm a trapper in the Gamber Pit. I have to trap without
a light, and I'm scared. I go at four and sometimes half-past
three in the morning and come out at five and half-past.
I never go to sleep. Sometimes I sing when I've
light, but not in the dark; I dare not sing then&hellip;.&rsquo; In
the West Riding the work of hurrying or pushing the
corves was often done by girls at the time of the report:
&lsquo;Chained, belted, harnessed like dogs in a go-cart, black,
saturated with wet, and more than half naked&mdash;crawling
upon their hands and feet, and dragging their heavy loads
behind them&mdash;they present an appearance indescribably
disgusting and unnatural.&rsquo;&nbsp;&hellip; The children who suffered
most were the apprentices from the workhouse;
&lsquo;these lads are made to go where other men will not let
their own children go. If they will not do it, they take
them to the magistrates who commit them to prison.&rsquo;&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;In
mines with thick seams it was usual to make good
roads, but in less profitable mines the roads were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
large enough to enable small children to get the corves
along them&hellip;. It was reported that there was much
more cruelty in the Halifax pits than in those of Leeds
and Braseford. A sub-commissioner met a boy crying
and bleeding from a wound in the cheek, and his master
explained &lsquo;that the child is one of the slow ones, who
would only move when he saw blood, and that by throwing
a piece of coal at him for that purpose he had accomplished
his object, and that he often adopted the like
means.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The entire community sanctioned these practices, not
the employers only; for generations even the miners themselves
acquiesced in them. Those who were sacrificed in
the mines and factories were victims of the entire consuming
community's war against hunger; the furious
drive of the acquisitive instinct on the one hand, and also
of the passionate longing of all men to escape from economic
bondage into security, plenty, economic and spiritual
freedom. It was war of a disastrous sort but the
world of that day saw no alternative,&mdash;could see no alternative
from the experience of the race. Until as individuals,
and nations and associations of nations, we have
won a stable economic surplus and the spiritual maturity
to use and distribute that surplus for the benefit of the
whole community, we shall not in our hearts condemn war
as immoral, whether it be a military or an industrial war.
Always we shall contrive to believe that what is necessary
for us is necessarily good.</p>

<p>People in general deplored the horrors of mining just
as before the coming of coal they had deplored the horrors
of the wars they had waged in order to survive, but the
fact remained that if the golden promise of the industrial
revolution was to be realized they must have coal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
what other way was there to get it? At least part of the
world was living in comfort and security.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact a fair share of the community
attained reasonable comfort after the coming of coal.
The acquisitive instinct succeeded in piling up a vast permanent
capital which was enjoyed by a large proportion
of the human race. It had not come through increased
production alone. Raiding and exploitation, both commercial
and military, had helped mightily, for the old
method of feeding yourself from your neighbor's hoard
was tremendously accelerated for those peoples whose
manufactures and transportation were driven by the
power of coal. That the exploited peoples suffered in
proportion as the raiding peoples prospered is, of course,
true, but among the dominant peoples themselves the
acquisitive instinct had begotten a mutual consciousness.
Throughout those parts of the world where coal had
induced the industrial revolution, a common civilization
had sprung up. Parallel with the triumphant acquisitive
instinct had developed the spirit of brotherhood and
mutual aid which limited and controlled it. The feeling
of fellowship which breeds civilization was practically
coextensive with the augmented surplus produced through
the coming of coal. Coal-driven transportation was good
enough so that a famine in one land could be met by the
heavy crops from another place: the fighting of disease,
the utilization of patents, the exchange of ideas, of luxuries,
of scientific knowledge, of passports, of fashions, and
of food, became international throughout a large part of
the world. Mankind began to approach a world civilization
because since the coming of coal to kill or starve was
no longer the inevitable choice.</p>

<p>That this alternative has even a chance of operating is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
due to the play and interplay of the two great fundamental
instincts in the soul of man&mdash;the acquisitive
instinct through which he learned to use coal to pile up the
material surplus that made civilization possible; and that
other impulse, an offspring of the acquisitive instinct,
which has swung into opposition to its parent but without
whose help that parent could never have achieved a surplus
on a large scale, the instinct of brotherhood, of
mutual aid, of cooperation. For without cooperation
among men there would have been lacking the tremendous
advantage of division of labor and mass production, and
no surplus, however large and secure it might have been,
could have resulted in civilization except through mutual
aid. Men learned to work together in order to survive;
they learned to enjoy the results of their labor together
in order to become civilized. These two impulses are
woven together in man's history from the start and it is
according as one or the other predominates that we develop
a civilization on the basis of our economic surplus,
or merely continue to exist and fight. This instinct of
mutual aid is as truly a cosmic force as the acquisitive
instinct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The original and elementary subjective fact in society
is the consciousness of kind,&rdquo; writes Professor Giddings,
&ldquo;&hellip; It is the basis of class distinction, of innumerable
forms of alliance, of rules of intercourse, and of
peculiarities of policy&hellip;. It is about the consciousness
of kind as a determining principle, that all other motives
organize themselves in the evolution of social choice,
social volition, or social policy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In any attempt to understand the function of coal in
the development of human society, it is necessary to remember
the universal democratic tendency of men similarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
circumstanced, to organize into defensive and offensive
groups. They organize into bar associations,
medical societies, religious denominations, manufacturers'
associations, and trade unions in obedience to a principle
as pervasive in the animate as the force of gravitation is
in the material world. While the primary driving force
behind each group as it organizes is the acquisitive
instinct, the natural reaching out for the means of subsistence,
for wages, fees, profits; for food, clothing, shelter,
then for more food, more clothing, better shelter,
still the actual attainment of the surplus makes possible
the widening operation of the consciousness of kind, and
turns men's minds toward all those attributes that are
characteristic of the good life in which both the individual
personality and also the spiritual being of the group, the
nation, and the race find fruition. For an economic surplus
is merely the condition of the good life, and the end
to which the human spirit forever strives to direct the
use of the surplus, is the good life itself&mdash;a worthy
civilization.</p>

<p>If the consciousness of kind had spread evenly like a
rising tide drawn by the swelling surplus of the age of
coal, a world civilization might have quickly come. But
it worked unevenly and erratically. Sometimes it spread
thinly over whole nations in the form of political beliefs
and produced theoretical democracies functioning through
the franchise. Sometimes it left the forms of government
severely monarchical and produced a spotty economic
growth in the form of cooperative societies that functioned
in response to the everyday bread and butter
needs. Sometimes it brought those having similar occupations
together in guilds and trade unions, that tended
to ignore mere political boundaries and make men internationally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
conscious of each other through the way they
got their living. But everywhere the rising consciousness
of kind came upon obstructions and divisions. Waves
hurrying up innocent-looking estuaries would come upon
other streams from the same great source, and meet in
spluttering, frothing conflict: a long even swell of
brotherly feeling would break over some rock of ancestral
race prejudice in disaster and bloodshed; mutual
aid rose in a murky troubled sea, wave against wave, one
current trying to beat another current back. People
united into a political nation opposed themselves violently
to those united into some economic class within it. Men
were driven apart when the interests of their group conflicted
with the interests of other groups almost as
strongly as they were drawn together by common interest
within their own organization.</p>

<p>And always the rise of any new group within a fairly
comfortable community met opposition from some already
established group whose privileges, powers, and possessions
the new group tended to infringe. They inevitably
appeared like an invading tribe bent on pillage, and the
community gathered shoulder to shoulder to resist them,
every thought and muscle set to repel what they saw as
an attack on the common surplus and in defence of those
whose guardianship of the common hoard had afforded
them a new measure of comfort.</p>

<p>This has been particularly true of all organizations, due
to the spread of consciousness of kind among the workers
and their efforts to get for themselves a larger share of
the benefits of the common surplus. Very rarely has the
community been able to see that what was distributed in
the form of advanced wages and better conditions was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
not necessarily taken away from the community as a
whole.</p>

<p>When the coal miners, actuated by the consciousness of
kind, began to organize for mutual aid and defence, the
community at large as well as the mine owners condemned
them as subversive conspirators, not only against their
lawful masters, but also against the general peace and
well-being of the nation, which was quite obviously
flourishing,&mdash;piling up a surplus with national security as
a by-product,&mdash;by reason of the thousands of tons of coal
which the newly organized group might conceivably curtail.
It was the community as a whole, not the employers
only, that sanctioned the use of the courts and the military
against the miners' union, as they would have countenanced
their use against soldiers who mutinied.</p>

<p>Only slowly is our community, to which the coming of
coal has given the chance to develop a world civilization,
beginning to see that neither the acquisitive instinct
through which men pile up a surplus, nor the consciousness
of kind through which they organize to build up a
civilization, is the result of individual perversity or
caprice. Unions and employers' associations arise in
obedience to a fundamental law of human conduct, they
are the means by which society wins its way out of chaos
and anarchy into peace and orderly government. Through
such group organizations men develop the understanding
of one another and of the community at large, which is
the foundation of brotherhood and civilized life. It is
through them that the community develops standards of
living; it is through them that the ideals of cooperation
acquire reality. It is by the acquisitive instinct that men
live; it is by the consciousness of kind, the instinct of
mutual aid and cooperation, that men are transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
into human beings. The interplay of these forces makes
the history of civilization&mdash;of nations and the great basic
industries within the nations. They are the flying shuttles
with which man at Time's loom weaves &ldquo;the living
garment of God.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coal in America</span></h3>

<p>The human significance of coal lies in the effect which
the release of its energy has exercised upon the struggle
between the acquisitive instinct and the consciousness of
kind for ascendancy over the soul of man. Through its
creature, the industrial revolution, it has given man command
of an economic surplus and set him free to win the
good life for each individual and to substitute mutual aid
for war in international relations if he will.</p>

<p>But the first effect of coal was not to usher in the good
life but to intensify the ancient struggle, widening its
stage from pocketed civilizations to the world. For more
than a hundred and fifty years, the abundant and readily
accessible coal of Great Britain made her the protagonist
in the world drama. Her acquisitive instinct, charged
with cosmic energy, shot lines of imperial expansion out
across the seas to America, India, Australia, China, and
Africa. Her coal-created wealth enabled her to maintain
the mastery of the ocean highways which she had won
from Spain and Holland and to hold it against Napoleonic
France and later against imperial Germany. It gave her
an economic surplus upon the basis of which the consciousness
of kind welded her people into one nation and
ended the civil wars which from the time of the Danish
invasion and the landing of William the Conqueror had
kept each little group within the island armed against
every other little group. And it transformed her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
jarring rapidity into a country that lived by manufacture
and by trade and supported a far larger population than
could have lived upon the island if it had been merely
an agricultural country raising its own food.</p>

<p>In order that this swelling population might go on getting
coal out of the mines and turning out products from
the factories it must be adequately and cheaply fed. The
place where its food came from was chiefly America.
During the hundred and fifty years of England's primacy,
America was not only her granary but increasingly the
granary of other nations, and the great reservoir for all
their overflowing populations. For the industrial revolution
in England was followed by the harnessing of coal
in France, then in Germany, then later in Japan, and this
set in motion among them the processes of imperial
expansion, whose friction and clash culminated in the
World War.</p>

<p>It was as necessary to the success of the industrial revolution,
particularly in specialized little England, that the
surplus populations which were poured by the million into
America should send back food to Europe, as it was that
their factory machines should have coal to drive them.
This interdependence was not conscious, not a deliberate
effort on either side, but it was an extremely practical
fact nevertheless. In order that England might live by
trade, some other land must live by agriculture, and
during the first hundred and fifty years of the industrial
revolution that land was America.</p>

<p>To live by agriculture was an easy thing in the New
World, easier than it had ever been anywhere before,&mdash;to
live and to feed a continent besides. For America is
the only great modern nation whose history is written
not against a background of famine but against a background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of economic abundance. After the first thin
stream of colonial adventurers and exiles for conscience'
sake had established themselves upon the Atlantic coast,
her seemingly boundless domain opened up before the
hungry millions of Europe like the promised land of milk
and honey. Unlike the peoples of the great Asiatic and
European folk-wanderings, they found no comparably
developed peoples to bar their way. As they spread from
the Atlantic to the Blue Ridge and Alleghenies, then
along the Great Lakes and down the Ohio; on across the
Mississippi, the Kansas prairies, the Great Desert, the
Sierras and Rockies to California and the Golden Gate,
they found only hunting tribes or the fading remnants of
cliff-dwelling and primitive agricultural clans. These
they could meet not only with effective weapons of
defence but also with a highly developed agricultural
technique.</p>

<p>At first America's planless prosperity had little to do
with coal and nothing at all with manufacture. It was
a prosperity made up of the sum of her food products,
and men skimmed the soil and the forests with only one
thought, to make that sum immediately great. Exploitation
got into their blood. It was the method by which they
grew rich, and when the wealth of the coal deposits was
added to the wealth of the fields and forests, they carried
the same methods of planless exploitation over into the
coal mines. England must still depend on them for food,
but they did not have to depend so abjectly on her for
manufactures after the industrial revolution crossed the
Atlantic at the call of the Pennsylvania coal fields.</p>

<p>After the industrial revolution harnessed their unique
reservoirs of coal, the people of the United States enjoyed
a degree of economic security such as no other people ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
enjoyed. Had they been spiritually prepared, they might
have used this economic abundance to establish brotherhood
among men. But after all, they themselves were
Europeans who had fled from the ancient tyranny of
hunger. To them America was naturally more an escape
from that haunting menace than a challenge to the good
life. Here and there, as in the Puritan theocracy, they
heard and tried to obey the challenge. But they were
not prepared.</p>

<p>The hungry immigrant millions swarmed across the
continent, laying waste the forests, skimming the fresh
fertile soil, growing prosperous by destruction rather than
by thrift and planful use. They caroused and swaggered
like prodigals. They glorified mere acquisition, measuring
a man's worth by the money he owned. As they filled
the continent, the old world fever of imperial expansion
entered their blood. They seized Cuba and the Philippines,
Haiti and Santo Domingo. They set about building
the greatest navy in the world. After a few faltering
efforts to lead the warring nations to peace through
conference and conciliation, they threw the weight of
their wealth and numbers into the balance and with fire
and sword imposed a victorious peace. And they were
able to do this in the last analysis because of the enormous
power of their coal supply, for coal in a modern
industrial civilization means guns and munitions of war,
transportation systems to set armies in the field, and the
ability to supply them after they get there. America's
coal-wrought wealth made her decisive in battle. Even
so today her unique reserves of coal make her the arbiter
between peace and war. Possessed of the richest coal
fields in the world, she holds the destiny of the nations
in her hands. For coal has grown to mean food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
clothing and shelter, transportation and communication,
and the economic surplus and the leisure without
which science, invention, art, representative government,
democratic education, and enlightened organized religion
would atrophy and perish.</p>

<p>Since coal means all these things, and since America
owns the world's greatest available reserves of coal, it is
obvious that the manner in which her people develop and
govern their coal fields is of crucial importance, not only
to themselves, but also to the rest of the world. Before
the United States entered the World War, her people
were hardly aware of this fact; even the momentous
experience of the war has but dimly impressed its meaning
upon the national mind.</p>

<p>Our coal measures underlie an area of more than four
hundred and sixty thousand square miles. They contain
almost four thousand billion tons of lignite, bituminous,
semibituminous, anthracite, and semianthracite coals.
About two-fifths of the world's annual output is mined in
the United States.</p>

<p>The very abundance of the supply has made us enormously
wasteful in its exploitation, as we have been wasteful
in the exploitation of our forests. Unlike the forests,
coal once destroyed does not grow again. The most valuable
of our coals are in the Appalachian bituminous fields
that stretch from northern Pennsylvania to Alabama, and
in which some of the best sections have already been
gutted and abandoned. In our greedy grasp for wealth,
we have left one ton of coal to waste underground for
every ton we have brought to the surface. More than one
hundred and fifty thousand miners have been drawn into
the mines in excess of efficient requirements. Planless
overexpansion of the industry has resulted in such irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
operation of plant and equipment that for more than
a generation the miners have lost an average of ninety-three
days in the working year of three hundred and eight
days, and a needless overhead charge has been imposed
upon the consumer which Mr. F. G. Tryon of the U. S.
Geological Survey calculates at a million dollars for each
working day. Planless exploitation has made the most
basic of our basic industries the prey of technical inefficiency
and social unrest, the extent of which we as a
people ignored until they threatened national and international
disaster at the crisis of the war.</p>

<p>This trouble might have gone on some time longer
undiagnosed if we had not met our first modern national
emergency in 1917. Of necessity the weight of the military
structure was added to the weight of the industrial
civil structure and the combined load was more than the
coal industry could bear. It bent and broke under it, and
in order to prosecute the war, the government was forced
to take hold of the formless inchoate thing and reshape it
into a stable prop for the national need. As a first step it
was necessary to find out what this great unwieldy coal
industry was.</p>

<p>Coal mines are systems of tunnels driven into the veins
where they crop out along the slopes of hills, or from the
foot of shafts sunk through the overlying strata. These
tunnels run for miles underground. Secondary tunnels
run from the main tunnel or heading into the rooms where
the miners work. The surveyor's diagram of a mine
looks like a crushed centipede. The getting of coal out of
the mines, after it has been picked or blasted down by the
miner, like its distribution after it is brought to the surface,
is almost entirely a problem of transportation.</p>

<p>Even in times of peace our railroad transportation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
an intricate and complicated thing. It had been repeatedly
regulated and re-regulated to bring it more in line with
community needs. Among other regulations was a law,
designed to give the public the benefit of as much competition
between operators as possible, which required the
railroads to furnish sidings and cars to all coal mines in
proportion to their production, with a preferential provision
for new operations. The double demand for coal
sent up prices and the rise in prices led to the opening of
new coal mines and the re-working of old abandoned ones.
All the eleven thousand mines, scattered more or less at
random over thousands of square miles of territory,
clamored for their legal quota of cars and transportation
to market. This competitive din aggravated the confusion
upon our already overtaxed railroads. At the critical
moment when the essential movement of troops and munitions
was straining the resources of the railroads, the
sprawling coal industry made their task impossible.</p>

<p>In peace times one-third of our ordinary bituminous
production is used to generate steam for transportation,
and more than one-third of all the tonnage carried by the
railroads is coal. The weight of the coal which the railroads
normally carry is double the weight of iron ore,
steel, lumber, wheat, corn, oats, and hay combined. The
problem of hauling this huge load is needlessly complicated
by competitive cross-shipments of coal from one
mining state into or across another. The producers of
Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Indiana sell their coal in from
eighteen to twenty states, many of them coal-mining
states. A part of this cross-shipment is necessary, because
certain mining states like Illinois, for example, do
not produce the grade of coking coal which their steel
plants need and which must, therefore, be brought from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
West Virginia or southern Pennsylvania. But most of it
is due to blind competitive planlessness and waste.</p>

<p>Upon this tangled mesh the critical demands of the war
placed a crushing burden. The nation's safety made it
imperative not only that coal should be produced, but that
it should be delivered where it was needed. The miners
were digging more coal than had ever been produced before,
yet cries of coal shortage went up from domestic
consumers and manufacturers all over the land. The railroads
themselves resorted to the confiscation of coal in
transit to keep their engines running. To avert impending
catastrophe to the nation and the world, the national
consciousness of kind asserted itself over the acquisitive
instinct of individuals and groups, and through the federal
government created the Fuel Administration which
brought the mines under unified public control and converted
the coal industry, for the period of the war, into
a unified public service.</p>

<p>From the high central tower of the Fuel Administration,
the people of the United States for the first time
caught a fleeting glimpse of the coal industry as a whole
and of the relation it bears to the national and international
industrial life. They discovered that coal bears
much the same relation to our modern industrial structure
that the water supply bears to the life of a great municipality.
When America entered the war, she resembled
with respect to her primary source of mechanical energy
a municipality dependent for its water supply upon eleven
thousand separate wells, owned and operated primarily
in their individual interests by thousands of enterprising
individuals, with hundreds of separate delivery systems
jostling in the highways that needed to be kept clear for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
soldiers and guns, its people bidding against one another,
offering fabulous prices for water, yet parched with thirst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Basic industries and transportation,&rdquo; writes Dr. Garfield,
in describing what he saw as head of the Fuel Administration,
&ldquo;were caught in a vicious circle. Steel could
not be manufactured without coke, coke could not be
made without coal; coal could not be commercially produced
without transportation; transportation was dependent
upon coal&hellip;. Industrially we were in a wild scramble
of manufacture, production, and shipment&hellip;. It
was no longer a question of withholding coal from non-war
industries but rather a question whether any coal
could much longer get through to any consumer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With eleven thousand coal mines in operation, the
engines of the nation were running cold for lack of coal.</p>

<p>Created to avert impending catastrophe, the Fuel Administration
went about the service of the nation much as
an engineer would tackle the job of converting eleven
thousand wells into a modern system of water supply. It
dealt with the coal fields as a single great reservoir of
fuel and power. It worked out a budget covering the
needs of the essential industries, the railroads, steel
plants, munition factories, gas and electric utilities, as well
as the domestic consumers. It made maps charting the
coal-producing and coal-consuming territories, divided
the nation into regional zones, established these zones as
fuel reservoirs, created a distributing organization by
zones and states like a great system of water mains. It
called the experienced operators and technical managers
into public service and entrusted to them the technical
problems of production and distribution. It fixed prices
limiting profits to an estimated fair return. It converted
the miners' union and the operators' organizations into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
administrative arms of the government for the industry,
with committees for conference and conciliation at the
mines, and in the various producing districts, heading up
in a Bureau of Labor at Washington as a final court of
appeal for the adjustment of disputes over wages and
working conditions.</p>

<p>For the period of the war, the coal industry functioned
as a cooperative public service. The coal budget, based
upon a detailed analysis of the country's resources and
needs, set a definite standard of performance both for the
industry and the railroads, and made it possible for them
to cooperate intelligently. The zones served as tools for
the control and direction of the flow of coal called for by
the budget. Mr. C. E. Lesher, Director of the Bureau of
Statistics of the Distribution Division, writes: &ldquo;In the
short period of a few months after the work of the Fuel
Administration was begun, it was determined that the requirements
of the United States for bituminous coal in
the coal year ended March, 1919, were 624,000,000 net
tons, compared with a production in 1917 of 552,000,000
tons of bituminous coal, and for anthracite 100,000,000
net tons, but slightly more than in 1917&hellip;. To provide
coal was the problem of the Distribution Division of the
Fuel Administration; to provide transportation was the
problem of the Railroad Administration&hellip;. The adoption
of the zoning system represented the supreme effort
of the Railroad Administration to overcome the transportation
tangle in connection with coal&hellip;. So closely did
the officials of the two administrations work, and so
effective were the measures employed, that the results
surprised all&hellip;. The Director of Operations of the
Railroad Administration in May, when production of
bituminous coal was averaging 11,500,000 tons a week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
believed that 11,800,000 was the highest that could be
expected in 1918, as the railroads were believed to have
reached their maximum capacity. Within a month records
of 12,500,000 tons a week were reached, and in July,
and again in September, the 13,000,000 ton mark was
passed&hellip;. When the armistice was declared, New
England, farthest from the mines, with an average of
20 weeks' supply, was literally gorged with soft coal, and
eastern New York and Pennsylvania, with from 6 to 9
weeks' stock, had abundant supplies&hellip;. From April 1
to July 6, 1918, rail shipments to New England were
3,058,000 net tons, or 98 per cent of the schedule of
3,150,000 tons; on September 28, shipments were 6,164,000
tons, or 105 per cent of the schedule for that date.
The schedule for shipments to tidewater from April 1 to
July 1 called for 11,916,000 net tons. By December 21
shipments were 9 per cent ahead of the program. The
Lake program called for 28,000,000 tons of cargo coal; a
total of 28,153,000 tons was supplied. With similar
precision and certainty munition factories, arsenals,
powder works, and by-product plants were kept running,
while stocks were accumulated, insuring uninterrupted
operations throughout the winter. In the same
manner retail dealers were given supplies for their domestic
trade. Such results were possible only because of
complete control of shipments and the full information
on which to proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was an amazing and illuminating demonstration
of the fact that our greatest national resource could be
administered for the benefit of the whole nation. It was
no longer a mere possibility, the thing had been done.</p>

<p>It has been said that this achievement was possible because
during the war the people had a common object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
which so challenged their higher ideals that they were
able to subordinate their individual and special group
interests to the service of the nation, to make their consciousness
of kind as a people triumphant over the acquisitive
instinct. Again it is said that human nature being
what it is, similar unselfish consecration is not to be
expected in the sluggish days of peace. But if the historical
record teaches us anything it is the essential falseness
of this assertion. That record shows us the gradual
irresistible spread of the consciousness of kind from one
realm of human activity to another as the acquisition of a
surplus makes this possible. It shows human understanding
reaching out to give all men religious freedom, to
assure them equal political rights; shows it asserting
human brotherhood in the right to education, health,
happiness&mdash;and these things not under the stress of war,
but in the conditions of peace. The possibility hangs not
on any technical inability, but on the better preparedness
of the minds of men, on their clearer vision, their
ability to see the spiritual implications of their technical
triumphs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Awakening of the Miners</span></h3>

<p>With the declaration of the armistice and the removal
of the incentive to cooperation in public service which the
war gave, the Fuel Administration and its elaborate
system of statistical control of production and distribution
was broken up as rapidly as it had been organized.
During the war, there had been gross examples of profiteering
just as there had been occasional local strikes, but
by and large the operators like the miners had conducted
themselves conscientiously as servants of the republic.
To a remarkable degree they subordinated their acquisitive
instinct to their consciousness of kind as citizens of
the nation whose life was threatened from without. But
within a year after the armistice, speculative profiteering
was rampant and the coal industry was paralyzed by a
general strike. Mr. Herbert Hoover, addressing the
American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers,
described the situation as a &ldquo;national emergency,&rdquo;
due to the fact that &ldquo;this industry, considered as a whole,
is one of the worst functioning industries in the United
States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How shall we account for this wide, swift swing of the
pendulum? Operators and owners who had offered their
skill to the government during the national crisis, rebelled
against all further &ldquo;interference with their private business.&rdquo;
They rebelled not only against price fixing and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
regulation of distribution, but even against all attempts on
the part of governmental agencies to keep congress and
the public informed of the elementary facts of ownership,
costs, wages, prices, and profits, without which public
opinion is helplessly blind. They sued out an injunction
against the Federal Trade Commission to block its
efforts to search out and publish these essential facts.
The unions also chafed under governmental restraint
upon their freedom of action, especially when the government
lifted its limitation on prices and left the consumer
at the mercy of an open market. As prices and profits
mounted, they felt entitled to commensurate wage increases.
The war, they said, was over though peace had
not been formally declared, and they demanded release
from the restraints of wartime legislation so that they
might freely exercise their economic pressure to secure
wage increases as the operators were taking increased
profits. For the first time in almost a generation they
laid down their tools, and finally submitted to the arbitration
of federal commissions only under threat of an
injunction and the imprisonment of their leaders. Economic
war and group rivalry took the place of cooperation
in public service.</p>

<p>The main reason for this violent reaction is probably to
be found in the fact that our modern democracies, the
United States in particular, were born in rebellion against
the autocratic authority of the feudal state, the fear and
hatred of which still attaches even to our representative
government. The memory of the Stuarts and Bourbons
and Hohenzollerns is still fresh in the modern democratic
consciousness, and accounts for the maxim that the government
is best which governs least. Through the revolutions
of the eighteenth century the merchants, manufacturers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and business men wrested from the monarch
his autocratic power, and it is against this same power
as exercised by the owners of property that the organized
labor movement is today in rebellion. But as against the
state when it exercises such autocratic authority as during
the war it exercised through the Fuel Administration,
both groups, owners and workers, unite. They assert the
right of self-government within their industry. Like the
economists and business men of the nineteenth century,
they contend that the conflict and balance of their selfish
interests will by some mysterious provision of nature neutralize
and resolve these selfishnesses to the advantage of
the community. The essence of this acquisitive philosophy
is expressed in the quaint nineteenth-century maxim
that &ldquo;greed is held in check by greed, and the desire for
gain sets limits to itself.&rdquo; But this leaves the service of
the community at the mercy of a blind conflict of forces
within the industry, as formerly it was at the mercy of
force exercised by the monarch who was the state, and
the public is increasingly dissatisfied with the result. The
public service conception of industry, and especially of
such basic industries as coal, is rapidly taking possession
of the public mind. People are coming to see that the
uncontrolled conflict of forces, like autocratic force itself,
is incompatible with the principle of service. Neither will
force exercised by the state through the courts solve the
difficulty. Compulsion is contrary to the spirit and genius
of democracy. The great problem of our generation is to
discover how industrial freedom can be reconciled with
the service of the public. For an answer we shall have to
look into the spirit and structure of such government as
our industries have themselves evolved. For democracy
is not, as its earlier critics declared, synonymous with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
anarchy. Democracy is a government of laws, not of
men; and laws in a democracy are not emanations of
superior minds, but the codified experience of the people.</p>

<p>As we approach the problem of government in our
basic industries as in the nation, we discover two seemingly
conflicting tendencies, two great elements in our
population apparently pulling in opposite directions. In
the question of national security and defence, the one
instinctively follows the ancient tradition of European
nations, piling up armies and navies, and striving to make
America the most formidable military power in the world;
the second leans to a policy of reconciliation, striving by
conference and understandings with other nations to prevent
disagreements and to avert wars. The first makes
it a matter of national honor to emphasize individual
American rights on land and sea, the property rights of
Americans, our financial and economic interests in backward
countries, and the military force necessary to enforce
those interests; the second aims to establish international
relations in which such rights and interests shall
be secure to all nations without the constant threat of
force. To the one, the world is an arena in which to fight
or starve is the eternal choice; to the second, the world
is a communion table at which all men are brothers.</p>

<p>These same tendencies, these same manifestations of
the acquisitive instinct and the consciousness of kind,
appear in the record of our basic coal industry. As the
industrial revolution got into full swing in America, during
and immediately following the Civil War, there was a
rush for the possession of the coal mines comparable to
the rush for land. Among the men who won possession,
there were some who were keenly aware of the public
obligations of ownership, who in friendly cooperation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with their employes strove to develop their properties in
the interest of the public as well as of their employes and
themselves. But owners and miners alike took their spiritual
color from their social environment and in the soul
of the people the acquisitive instinct remained in the
ascendant. Men did not go into business or swing their
tools for their health. Their first duty, as they saw it,
was to make all the money they could as fast as they
could, and to put themselves and those dependent upon
them on easy street. &ldquo;God helps them,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;who
help themselves.&rdquo; They gutted the richest veins for quick
profit, as our forests and new lands had been gutted.
More mines were opened than the nation could possibly
use. There was a gluttonous overdevelopment of the
industry which swung up and down in high peaks and low
plunges of prosperity and depression, high prices and &ldquo;no
market,&rdquo; feverish employment and long stretches of intermittent
work, which for hundreds of thousands of miners
meant no work at all, and for many operators meant
bankruptcy. The level of government in the industry was
in all essential respects the level of hunting tribes.</p>

<p>During the early days of the industry, the miners, like
American manual workers in general, were under the
popular illusion that democracy meant the passing of a
permanent working class. With the Declaration of Independence
the old social stratification of feudal Europe
had been wiped out forever. There was plenty of room
at the top. Everybody might with perseverance and thrift
get to the top. This illusion took on considerable substance
from the fact that when the industrial revolution
first invaded the coal fields America still offered great
tracts of unoccupied lands to satisfy the universal land
hunger, whereas in England, for example, the policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
enclosure barred poor men from such untilled land as
there was. This circumstance accounts for the slow and
erratic development of group organization among American
miners as compared with the English. There were
many cases like that of the bituminous miners in Maryland,
who went into the mines; took wages and working
conditions as they found them; organized; fought for
better wages and working conditions; accumulated a little
money; and then, instead of using it to build a permanent
organization, broke away for the free lands of the West.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their ambition in life,&rdquo; writes Andrew Roy, himself
at the time a miner, &ldquo;was to save enough money to buy a
farm in Iowa or Wisconsin. They would go back to the
mines in the autumn after harvesting, work all winter,
and return with their fresh stake in the spring. None of
them ever returned permanently to the mines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as the fertile lands were preempted and America
became increasingly a manufacturing nation, the coal
industry acquired a measure of stability and drew into the
mining communities an increasing body of men for whom
mining was to be a life's work. The condition of life for
these permanent miners was largely determined by the
camps or villages which the companies built at the mines.
These were generally mean, cheap, temporary affairs.
For the faster the miner works, the faster he skims the
cream, leaving the more inaccessible coal to waste where
it lies, the greater the profit, the better the wages, and the
sooner the mine is worked out and abandoned. This, and
the caprice of the market in its effect upon the overexpanded
industry, meant that the miner must live in his
knapsack always prepared to move; and it meant cheap
homes and a mean domestic equipment, houses or shacks
that might be abandoned without serious loss. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
day the great majority of mining villages have the worst
characteristics of city slums intensified by the isolation
and loneliness of the country, once beautiful, but now
stripped of its forests, its streams running black with the
sulphurous waste of the mines. Such moderately attractive
cities as Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton in the
anthracite region are exceptional. The mining towns that
sprawl between Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, or that follow
the Panther Creek Valley, are incredibly hideous
things. And what is true of the compact and peculiarly
prosperous anthracite region is even more true of the
sprawling bituminous fields.</p>

<p>The isolation and transitory character of the mining
towns made the miners almost completely dependent upon
the owners of the mines not only for homes but also for
tools and powder; all their mining, as well as their household,
supplies. To this day in the non-union fields of
West Virginia the operators finance and control, not only
the stores, but the schools, the hospitals, the doctors, the
churches, and the police. Independent merchants were
slow to invest their fortunes in such difficult ground, and
since the company store was a convenient means of supplementing
the profit from the mines, independent merchants
were not encouraged to compete. These conditions
tended on the one hand to breed arbitrary management,&mdash;autocracy
sometimes benevolent, sometimes tyrannical,&mdash;and
on the other, restlessness, discontent, and the spirit
of individual and organized revolt. It set the consciousness
of kind in action among the miners especially, and
resulted in innumerable local lockouts and strikes.</p>

<p>A sequence of such local struggles occurred in the
Blossburg district of Pennsylvania in the '60's and '70's.
The Civil War created an abnormal demand for coal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sent up the price as well as the cost of living generally.
In 1863 the miners of the district organized and succeeded
in raising their wage rate from thirty-five cents to
a dollar and ten cents a ton. At the end of the war, the
market broke and the coal fields were flooded with returning
soldiers. To protect the standard of living to which
during the war they had attained, the miners decided upon
a defensive offensive and demanded a further increase of
fifteen cents a ton. The operators insisted upon the
liquidation of labor. A strike followed. The owners
ordered the miners to vacate their company houses. They
refused. The local courts issued writs of eviction. To
avoid a clash with the sheriff and his deputies, the miners
made a holiday in the hills, leaving their hearthstones to
their wives. By passive resistance and otherwise, the
women held their castles. Then the operators appealed
to the governor who sent in the famous Bucktail regiment
just victoriously back from the war. They put the miners,
their families, and their household goods on the street.
The strike was broken. Such miners as were not deported
or blacklisted were compelled to accept the terms
that were offered, including a pledge to abandon and keep
out of their union. So the pendulum swung in 1865.</p>

<p>In 1873 the swing was reversed. Most of the mine
owners of Blossburg were also either bankers or retail
merchants through their company stores. They were hard
hit by the panic of 1873. Without consultation or warning
they announced an arbitrary reduction in wages and
deferred payment of wages already due. In November
they posted notices that the miners might get such goods
as they absolutely needed at the company stores, but that
no wages would be paid until the following April. Then
the miners again drew together in a union. The operators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
organized in opposition. A lockout strike followed.
Strike breakers were brought in, principally a group of
recent Swedish immigrants, and marched to a barracks
especially prepared for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strikers gathered on the public highway in front
of the barracks,&rdquo; says Andrew Roy, &ldquo;and insisted on the
right to talk with the strikebreakers through one of their
interpreters. The managers declined to allow this to be
done. But finally a Swedish miner got in among them,
and within an hour, the whole of the imported men
marched out upon the highway and joined the strikers.
The strangers were formed into line, with a Scotch piper
at their head, who marched them out of town to the
stirring tune of the McGregors' Gathering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prevailing public opinion in the '70's, like the prevailing
judicial interpretation of the law, frowned upon concerted
action by the workers as having the nature of a
conspiracy much as the concerted action of the commoners
in monarchical days was frowned upon as conspiracy.
But curious <ins title="sports">sorts</ins> of circumstances have occasionally
arisen to modify opinion in one case as in the other. The
Boston Tea Party is our historical example in the political
realm. In Blossburg, before this strike of 1873, the
miners had been compelled to take their pay in company
scrip. Except at the company store, this scrip was worth
only from seventy to ninety cents on the dollar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When farmers came into mining towns,&rdquo; writes Andrew
Roy out of his own experience, &ldquo;prospective purchasers
of their produce would ask them, &lsquo;Will you take
scrip?&rsquo; And if the answer was in the affirmative, a
dicker would immediately be entered into as to the amount
of discount to be allowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Independent merchants had gradually ventured into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Blossburg. To them the scrip was a competitive injury.
When the operators limited the miners to credit at the
company stores, the independent merchants protested to
the Treasury Department of the United States that the
compulsory circulation of company scrip was an illegal
infringement of a governmental function. The governor
of Pennsylvania took alarm at this appeal over his head
and sent the State Secretary of Internal Affairs to investigate.
He made a report condemning the operators' practice.
The attendant publicity scandalized public opinion
and turned it to the miners' side. This time the strike
was won.</p>

<p>So by ebb and flow of the consciousness of kind, the
elements of a governing structure, the balance of forces
between the operators and the miners, gradually formed
within the industry. But in the main the balance was
determined by public opinion; and public opinion, like the
law, was by inherited tradition upon the side of the
owners, the accepted custodians of property and the
national wealth. Episodes like the use of company scrip
tended to even the balance. And more important still in
their effect upon the traditional hostility of public opinion
toward the unions in their infringement upon the vested
rights and privileges of the owners were the great mine
disasters.</p>

<p>Some of our coal crops out at the surface in places
where through the ages wind and weather have worn
away the overlying clay, stone, and slate. This can be
gathered like wood in the forest without danger. The
amount of such coal is commercially unimportant. Some
lies only a few feet underground so that it is possible to
take it by stripping away the thin overlying material and
blast and scoop it out with a steam shovel. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
some stripping mines in the anthracite field and a considerable
number in the alluvial plains of the West. But
the great bulk of our coal is reached by driving drifts or
headings into the veins through the sides of hills or by
sinking shafts scores, or hundreds, or thousands of feet
down through the earth to where the coal lies. From the
mouth of the drift or the foot of the shaft, a tunnel or
main heading or gangway is driven on and on into the coal
usually for miles, with secondary tunnels giving off the
main heading into the pitch-black rooms where the miners
work. In the cryptlike terminal rooms, the miner with his
buddy undercuts the &ldquo;face&rdquo; of the coal with his pick or
with an undercutting machine, drills shot-holes into the
face, sets his charge of powder and tamps it in, and then
shoots the coal down. Sometimes, for the sake of speed,
he shoots it down without undercutting, and in the anthracite
mines where the coal is too hard for undercutting,
direct shooting from the face is the general practice.
This blasting of a friable and inflammable substance fills
the cellared air with minute particles of highly explosive
dust. As the mines go deeper and further away from the
opening they accumulate gas and underground water.
The greatest number of injuries and deaths in the mines,
and coal mining is among the most hazardous of all occupations,
result from the falling of overhanging rock and
coal; but the catastrophies which have shocked public opinion
into a sympathetic attitude toward the commoners of
the mines do not come from this steady death toll but
have resulted from explosions or fires that have trapped
and suffocated or burned their scores and hundreds.</p>

<p>It seems incredible, in view of the known hazards of
underground work, that there should ever have been opposition
to the installation of all available safeguards. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
it must be remembered that we are still very close to
primitive man, that the consciousness of kind and the
instinct of brotherhood are still hard pressed by the primal
acquisitive instinct. In America in spite of potential
plenty the community's first preoccupation was escape
from hunger, the winning of individual and national
economic security. The prevailing attitude toward death
and injury in the mines was, and to a great extent still is,
much the same as the prevailing attitude toward death
and injury in battle. In ordinary days of peace we do not
glorify the soldier. Similarly, it is only at time of disaster
that our sympathetic understanding goes out to the shock
troops in our war against nature, the men who with pick
and powder win coal underground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So numerous and heartrending,&rdquo; says Roy, &ldquo;had these
accidents become (in the anthracite field) that the miners
of Schuylkill county in the year 1858 appealed to the
legislature for the passage of a law to provide for official
supervision of the mines, and a bill for the purpose was
introduced the same year; but it found no countenance,
and never came to a vote. In 1866 it was again introduced,
and passed the lower house, but it was defeated in
the Senate. In 1869 it was reintroduced, passed both
houses and received the approval of the governor of the
state. It provided for <i>one</i> mine inspector for Schuylkill
county, <i>the other counties being left out</i>. The law had
been in operation only a few months when the Avondale
shaft in the adjoining county of Luzerne took fire and
suffocated every soul in the mine including two daring
miners who went down the mine after the fire, in the
hope of rescuing some of the entombed men. The shaft
had but one opening&hellip;. The whole underground force
of the mine, 109 souls, were suffocated to death by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
gases emanating from the burning woodwork in the shaft
and the breakers on top of it&hellip;. No catastrophe ever
occurred in this country which created a greater sensation
than this mining horror. The public press united in
demanding the passage of all laws necessary for the protection
of the health and lives of the miners&hellip;. When
the legislature met in the following January a committee
of representative miners was sent to Harrisburg to have
a mining bill enacted into law for the proper security of
the lives, health, and safety of the anthracite miners of
Pennsylvania, which was promptly done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stirred by the Avondale disaster, the miners of the
Mahoning Valley in Ohio had a bill introduced into the
Ohio legislature calling for two separate openings in all
mines employing more than ten men underground, for the
forced circulation to the face of the coal of at least one
hundred cubic feet of air per minute for each underground
worker, the daily inspection of all gaseous mines by a fireviewer
before the miners were allowed to enter, the
appointment of four state mine inspectors, and the right
of the miners to appoint a check-weighman at their own
expense to see that their coal was fairly weighed at the
tipple. As soon as the bill was printed, a committee of
thirteen operators representing every mining district in
the state, supported by legal counsel and the state geologist,
appeared in opposition. Their contention was that
the miners of the state did not want the law, that the bill
was the invention of professional demagogues and labor
agitators who sponged a fat living off the ignorance and
cupidity of their misguided followers, that there was
neither gas nor bad air in Ohio mines, that the lives and
fortunes of the miners were safe in the hands of their
employers, that the bill was special legislation and unconstitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and that if enacted by the General Assembly of
Ohio it would be set aside by the Supreme Court. The
bill was defeated, but a commission of inquiry was appointed.
At the next session of the General Assembly the
miners' bill was reintroduced and passed by a unanimous
vote. But before it was sent to the governor, the operators
again sent a committee to defeat it. It was amended
and all provision for state inspection of the mines stricken
out. In the following June a disaster occurred in a mine
in Portage county owned by the member of the legislature
who had emasculated the bill. This mine, too, had
but one opening which an accidental fire converted into a
furnace. There were twenty-one men in the mine. Ten
were burned to death and the eleven who managed to
escape through the smoke and flame were terribly injured.
The miners' bill was reintroduced and again opposed.
Judge Hoadly, afterwards governor of Ohio, speaking in
opposition very accurately expressed the prevailing state
of mind. &ldquo;We have tried to make men sober and moral
by law,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now we are going to try to surround
them with protection against carelessness and
danger, and enable them to shut their eyes and walk in
darkness, satisfied with the care and protection of the
state. I admit that there is a line to which the right of
the legislature&mdash;the duty of the legislature&mdash;may go
without infringing on the natural right of the citizen; but
what I want to suggest as the safe side, is to leave the people
free, and to allow mishap and disaster to have its
natural effect as the penalty for and the cure of the evils
which result from negligence which causes mishap and
disaster.&rdquo; But in spite of this persuasive reasoning, the
miners' bill, after years of effort, was finally enacted into
law.</p>

<p>Thus slowly the consciousness of kind worked through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the public to the miners, under the influence of such
understanding as mining catastrophies shocked into the
public mind. But the main force that made for the improvement
of their conditions of work, for the development
of standards of living among them and of orderly
processes of government within the industry as a whole
was the operation of the consciousness of kind within
their own group.</p>

<p>The processes of civilization like all cosmic processes
are slow. The period of recorded history is but a minute
in the unnumbered years of man's life upon earth. It
was by slow stages that the blind herd instinct which
sends wolves hunting in packs and leads birds to migrate
in flocks merged into the consciousness of kind and the
spirit of service among men. So in the coal industry, the
miners organized slowly, first in local groups, then by
districts, then on a national scale with the beginnings of
international affiliations. They drew together into unions,
broke apart, drew together again. As they acquired
strength, their interests came into conflict with the interests
of the coal owners. There were strikes and lockouts,
local joint agreements, then strikes and lockouts again,
then other agreements for arbitration and conciliation,
then more strikes and lockouts. That process still goes
on as in the bitter civil war in West Virginia. But in the
main it reached a culmination so far as the coal industry
is concerned when in 1902 President Roosevelt intervened
in the interests of the consumers, asserted a balance
of power between and over the two groups, and established
the foundations of orderly government within the
industry. The processes by which representative government
has grown up within the industry run closely parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
with the processes by which the parliamentary government
arose in the European political states, with property
owners performing the very important function of technical
organization and development which in the early
stages of national life the monarch and his executives
performed, and the miners playing the r&ocirc;le of the commoners.
It is upon this historical structure that the
future of the industry as a public service depends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Struggle for Organization</span></h3>

<p>In their volume on The Church and Industrial Reconstruction,
the Committee on the War and the Religious
Outlook, an interdenominational group appointed
by the joint action of the Federal Council of Churches
and the General Wartime Commission of the Churches,
declare that &ldquo;Democracy is the attempt to realize this
fundamental right of every personality to self-expression
through cooperation with others in a common task. In
the political sphere it has already found large recognition&hellip;.
It applies, or should apply, in the sphere of
organized religion, which is the Church. It applies in
the sphere of industry. Indeed, it may be of relatively
small significance for men to have the right of political
self-expression, unless they have similar opportunity for
self-expression in their daily work. For the conditions
which affect them in industry touch them more closely
than the concerns of the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is for this reason that the study of the growth of
democratic organization and government in industry inevitably
stresses the growth of organization and orderly
processes among the workers, the commoners of industry.
The political revolution of the eighteenth century
emancipated the owners of property from the autocratic
control of the monarchical state. But, as Sidney and
Beatrice Webb have pointed out, &ldquo;the framers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
United States Constitution, like the various parties in
the French Revolution of 1789, saw no resemblance or
analogy between the personal power which they drove
from the castle, the altar, and the throne, and that which
they left unchecked in the farm, the factory, and the mine.
Even at the present day, after a century of revolution, the
great mass of middle- and upper-class 'Liberals' all over
the world see no more inconsistency between democracy
and unrestrained capitalist enterprise, than Washington
and Jefferson did between democracy and slave-owning.
The &lsquo;dim, inarticulate&rsquo; multitude of manual-working
wage-earners have, from the outset, felt their way to a
different view. To them, the uncontrolled power wielded
by the owners of the means of production, able to withhold
from the manual worker all chance of subsistence
unless he accepted their terms, meant a far more genuine
loss of liberty, and a far keener sense of personal subjection,
than the official jurisdiction of the magistrate, or
the far-off, impalpable rule of the king. The captains of
industry, like the kings of yore, are honestly unable to
understand why their personal power should be interfered
with&hellip;. The agitation for freedom of combination and
factory legislation has been, in reality, a demand for a
&lsquo;constitution&rsquo; in the industrial realm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What the Committee on the War and the Religious
Outlook and the Webbs state in slightly different language
explains why the history of constitutional government in
industry is fundamentally the history of the rise of the
workers through their unions and collective bargaining
toward a democratic equality of status with their
employers.</p>

<p>As soon as the mining communities became sufficiently
stable to allow the consciousness of kind to operate, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
miners began to organize into small local groups for
mutual aid, to care for one another in sickness, to bury
one another at death, and to improve their wages and
working conditions. But it was not until after the industrial
revolution got under full headway during and immediately
after the Civil War that they became actively conscious
of a community of interest over wide areas. For
the structure of modern democratic government in industry
as in nations and among nations, depends upon railroads,
the postal and telegraph service, and other means
of communication. A strong impetus and a definite direction
was given to the existing tendency toward organization
by the steady infiltration of miners from Great
Britain where constitutional government in the coal industry
had already made considerable progress and where the
miners were firmly organized. The miners held their
first national convention in St. Louis, Missouri, in January,
1861. The call had been issued by Daniel Weaver,
an English trade-unionist, who after the failure of the
Chartist movement had settled in the coal fields of Illinois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The necessity of an association of miners and of those
branches of industry immediately connected with mining
operations, having for its object the physical, mental, and
social elevation of the miner, has long been felt by the
thinking portion of the miners generally,&rdquo; said Weaver in
his call. &ldquo;Union is the great fundamental principle by
which every object of importance is to be accomplished.
Man is a social being and if left to himself in an isolated
condition is one of the weakest of creatures, but when
associated with his kind he works wonders&hellip;. There
is an electric sympathy kindled, the attractive forces inherent
in human nature are called into action and a stream
of generous emotion binds together and animates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
whole&hellip;. Our unity is essential to the attainment of
our rights and the amelioration of our present condition&hellip;. Our
safety, our remedy, our protection, our
dearest interests, and the social well-being of our families,
present and future, depend upon our unity, our duty, and
our regard for each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The convention formed the American Miners' Association,
elected Weaver secretary and Thomas Lloyd, another
English immigrant, president. A considerable number
of miners in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
and Maryland joined the union, which exerted a mild
influence upon the legislatures of the several states. But
the Association was a national organization in name only.
The miners had not yet learned to work together under
the direction of their own leaders. The organization was
not strong enough to withstand the break in the labor
market and the anti-union drive that attended the flood
of returning soldiers at the end of the Civil War. Moreover,
the American public regarded the trade union as an
alien institution, the evil creation of &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; and
alien &ldquo;agitators.&rdquo; It was held to be contrary to the
genius of American life that workers should combine to
interfere with the sanctity of property and the prerogatives
that inhered in that sanctity just as it had been so
held in England a century before. Even by the great
majority of wage workers as by the public at large the
accepted theory, carried over from the feudal tradition
of Europe, was that the rights and interests of both would
be best protected and cared for &ldquo;by the Christian men to
whom God has given control of the property interests of
the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under stress of the panic of 1873, and after a series of
unsuccessful strikes to maintain wages, the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Miners' Association went to pieces. But local unions,
generally known as &ldquo;Miners' and Laborers' Benevolent
Associations,&rdquo; kept up a struggling existence. The
strongest of these was the Workingmen's Benevolent
Association, a consolidation of all the local unions in the
anthracite field. It was largely the creation of John
Siney, an Englishbred Irishman, among the keenest minds
the labor movement has produced. One of the first acts
of this Benevolent Association was to declare a suspension
of work in order to relieve the mines of the glut of
coal which had resulted from the slack industrial period
following the Civil War. This maneuver met with condemnation
of the press and from the operators, who did
not, nevertheless, regard it with entire disfavor, since
it had a considerable effect in maintaining prices as well
as wages. As soon as the suspension had accomplished its
purpose the miners returned to work, and immediately
thereafter John Siney succeeded in persuading the anthracite
owners to enter a conference with representatives of
the union. The first joint meeting of operators and
miners was held in Scranton in 1869, and as a result of
this conference the first joint agreement ever made between
American miners and operators for the establishment
of a wage scale was signed on July 29, 1870, by
five members of the Anthracite Board of Trade and five
representatives of the Workingmen's Benevolent Association.</p>

<p>This unique achievement made Siney a national figure.
Local leaders in all parts of the country appealed to him
to call another national convention. On his initiative, the
Miners' National Association was constituted by the convention
held in Youngstown, Ohio, in October, 1873. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
convention elected Siney president. National headquarters
were opened in Cleveland.</p>

<p>Wearied with endless strikes the convention had made
arbitration, conciliation, and cooperation the basic principles
of their constitution. Fortified with these principles,
Siney and an associate visited the offices of all the
coal companies in Cleveland. All except one of the operators
turned them down. They would have nothing to do
with a union. The exception was Marcus A. Hanna.
When Siney assured Hanna that no strike would be called
without previous resort to arbitration and that the officers
of the union would order the men to keep at work even if
an award went against them, Hanna accepted their proposition
and undertook to bring the other operators into
line. In spite of the widespread depression in the coal
trade the National Association grew rapidly. Twenty-one
thousand members were represented at the second
convention held in Cleveland in October, 1874. But notwithstanding
Hanna's great influence, many of the operators
remained hostile to the union. Toward the close of
1874, the operators of the Tuscarawas Valley in Ohio
announced a wage cut from ninety to seventy cents a ton.
The miners determined to strike. Siney induced them
to resort to arbitration. The umpire admitted a reduction
to seventy-one cents. The miners were bitter against the
decision which had gone almost completely against them.
Only the great influence of Siney restrained them from
striking at once.</p>

<p>Then one of the operators, the Crawford Coal Company,
took advantage of the discontent. This company
had refused to join Hanna and his associates in dealing
with the union. During the arbitration proceedings, the
Crawford Company locked out their men for demanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
a check-weighman, and appealed to the operators' association
for support. The associated operators refused. The
Crawford Company then offered their locked-out men an
advance of nine cents a ton above the rate fixed for the
union miners by the arbitration award. The acquisitive
instinct was stronger than the consciousness of kind
among the non-union miners. They accepted and went
back to work.</p>

<p>This turn of the wheel broke Siney's control over the
organization. His followers threatened to desert unless
he repudiated the arbitration award. He refused. But
his executive board, in a desperate effort to save the
union, overruled him and yielded. Strikes and lockouts
followed in quick succession. Hanna was as helpless as
Siney. Strike breakers were imported, under cover men
and troops were brought in. Arbitration, constitutional
government, and the union went on the rocks.</p>

<p>Similar misfortune attended Siney's pioneer efforts to
establish the union and constitutional government in his
home district at Clearfield, Pennsylvania. No sooner had
the miners joined the National Association than they
expected Siney and his fellow executives to achieve quick
redress of their grievances and to force an advance in
wages. They grew impatient with the slow processes of
negotiation. They struck against the advice of Siney.
Immediately the operators in the Clearfield district followed
the precedent of Tuscarawas. They brought in
strike breakers and troops. A brief civil war followed.
Some heads were broken. The strike was lost. In spite
of his heroic efforts to keep the peace and to establish
orderly processes of government, Siney was arrested for
conspiracy and thrown into jail. The morale of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Miners' National Association was broken, and like its
predecessors it went by the board.</p>

<p>Like the tides of the sea, the consciousness of kind
ebbed and flowed among the miners. They drew together
into local, state, and national organizations, held for brief
periods, and then scattered again under the impact of the
operators supported by prevailing public opinion. They
had not become fully group conscious; neither had the
public come to recognize their unions as essential arms of
constitutional government within the industry.</p>

<p>In the bounteous days of national expansion, in the
exuberant '70's and '80's, a vague belief was abroad that
America would never develop a permanent working class.
Every man was &ldquo;as good as&rdquo; another, and the hustling,
self-made business man was the American ideal. In
accord with this theory was one of the significant actions
of the Miners' National Association, an attempt to buy
coal lands to be operated by the miners, not as a workers'
cooperative association, but as a corporation of business
men. During the '70's and the '80's also the Knights of
Labor built up a great following among the wage-workers,
largely on the philosophy that if they kept free of
&ldquo;class-conscious&rdquo; trade unions and went in for a mass
movement of all workers, they could by some strange
alchemy of the American spirit rise to the status of independent
business men. The Knights of Labor played
much the same r&ocirc;le among the wage-workers that the
various &ldquo;populist&rdquo; movements played among the farmers
before the development of such group-conscious tendencies
as those which in our day have developed the
farmers' cooperative societies and the agricultural bloc.</p>

<p>The labor movement as we know it today in America
began when in 1886 Samuel Gompers became first president<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of the American Federation of Labor, an office
which with the interruption of a single year he has held
ever since. Mr. Gompers led the wage-workers to a
frank acceptance of the prevailing business and acquisitive
ideals as the basis, not of individual escape from the
working class, but of their consolidation into trade
unions for the businesslike control and sale of their craft
skill through collective bargaining. It is significant that
the immediate precursor of the American Federation of
Labor&mdash;the Organized Trades Unions of the United
States of America and Canada, over whose councils Mr.
Gompers exercised great influence&mdash;demanded the legal
incorporation of trade unions and a protective tariff for
American labor, as well as the prohibition of child labor
under fourteen, the eight-hour day, the abolition of conspiracy
laws, and the other reforms which constitute the
present program of organized labor. By the frank recognition
of the basic force of the acquisitive instinct in
human nature, the realistic leaders of the new labor
movement were able to release and consolidate the consciousness
of kind for effective operation within the
wage-working group.</p>

<p>The influence of this new philosophy made itself felt
throughout all the skilled trades and notably among the
miners. After the break-up of the Miners' National Association,
the miners maintained state organizations in
Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and in several other states.
They steadily took the initiative in seeking conferences
and negotiations with the operators of their districts. In
spite of the failure of arbitration under the pioneering
leadership of Siney, they supported the agitation which
resulted in the Trade Tribunal Act of Pennsylvania
(1883), and the similar arbitration act of Ohio (1885).</p>

<p>But the process of overdevelopment which has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
characterized the American coal industry created sharp
fluctuations of prosperity and market depression and
afforded an unstable basis for the establishment of the
machinery of orderly government. Both miners and
operators showed a tendency to run wild. Conferences
were held, arbitration agreements occasionally entered
into, but now one side, now the other, repudiated the
awards as the fluctuating market sent prices erratically up
and down. The needs of the community have always
called for the integration of the industry, but the happy-go-lucky
American spirit persistently shied away from
public regulation as long as the acquisitive instinct could
be satisfied at however great a cost in profligate use and
waste. But this very overdevelopment, with its destructive
effect upon wages and regularity of employment,
continually brought the miners back to a consciousness
of the need for national organization.</p>

<p>In 1885, John McBride, president of the Ohio Miners'
State Union, and later, for a single term, president of the
American Federation of Labor, issued a call to the miners
of the United States to meet in convention on the ninth of
September in Indianapolis. Seven states sent delegates.
The National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers
was formed and its Executive Board issued a call <i>to the
mine operators of the United States and territories</i>
inviting them to a joint meeting for the purpose of adjusting
market and mining prices in such a way as to
avoid strikes and lockouts, and to give to each party an
increased profit from the sale of coal. Only one operator,
Mr. W. P. Rend of Chicago, paid any attention to this
call. He inspired the miners to persevere. They sent out
a second invitation. A dozen or so operators met with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
executive board in Chicago and agreed upon a joint call
for a national joint convention to be held in Pittsburgh
in December.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The undersigned committee,&rdquo; the invitation said, &ldquo;consisting
of three mine owners, and three delegates representing
the miners' organization, were appointed to make
a general public presentation of the objects and purposes
of this convention, and to extend an invitation to all those
engaged in coal mining in America, to lend their active
cooperation toward the establishment of harmony and
friendship between capital and labor in this large and
important industry&hellip;. Apart and in conflict capital and
labor become agents of evil, while united they create
blessings of plenty and prosperity&hellip;. Capital represents
the accumulation, or savings, of past labor, while
labor is the most sacred part of capital&hellip;. It is evident
that the general standard of reward for labor has sunk
too low&hellip;. It is equally true that the <ins title="wide-spread">widespread</ins> depression
of business, the overproduction of coal, and the
consequent severe competition have caused the capital
invested in mines to yield little or no profitable returns.
The constant reductions of wages that have lately taken
place have afforded no relief to capital, and, indeed, have
tended to increase its embarrassments&hellip;. This is the
first movement of a national character in America, taken
with the intention of the establishment of labor conciliation&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response to this call a small joint meeting was held
in Pittsburgh in December. It adjourned for a second
conference in Columbus, Ohio, in February, 1886. Here
the operators were represented by seventy-seven delegates,
principally from Ohio, but also from Pennsylvania,
Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, and West Virginia. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
adopted a national wage scale, established a national
board of arbitration, and provided for the creation of
similar state boards to maintain industrial peace and to
develop the structure and processes of constitutional
government.</p>

<p>The agreement held and worked in spite of the opposition
of groups of operators, notably in the West Virginia
field and the steel district of Pittsburgh, and the individualistic
lethargy of many of the miners. The new philosophy
of business trade unionism gripped the miners, made
the trade union policy triumphant over the vaguely utopian
policy of the Knights of Labor, and resulted in the
consolidation of the miners' organizations into the United
Mine Workers of America in 1890. But the process of
overdevelopment continued in the industry. The workings
of the joint machinery creaked and faltered under
the impact of strikes and lockouts due in the main to
market fluctuations, and for a decade the United Mine
Workers, in spite of periods of prosperity and rapid
growth, was perpetually threatened with the fate of its
predecessors.</p>

<p>This fate was averted by the economic developments
which had converted the compact anthracite field into a
virtual monopoly under the combined control of the
anthracite railroads and the great banking houses of the
East that owned the railroads. While the bituminous
industry sprawled and overdeveloped, the anthracite combination
gradually restricted the production of anthracite
to the calculable demand of the market. This made for
stability in the anthracite field, which is reflected in the
fact that while even today the average working year in
the bituminous fields is approximately two hundred and
fifteen days,&mdash;an average working day when spread over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the year, of less than four hours,&mdash;the working year in the
anthracite field gradually rose until today it holds steady
at something more than two hundred and sixty days a
year.</p>

<p>This stability enabled the anthracite miners to accumulate
an economic surplus above their immediate needs and
set the consciousness of kind in vigorous operation among
them. By 1900 they had developed the nucleus of a
strong organization. Their wages, however, had lagged
behind the wages of the miners in the better-organized
bituminous fields. On their demand, the national officers
of the United Mine Workers called a convention of
anthracite representatives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, &ldquo;to
devise means by which a joint convention of operators
and miners can be held&rdquo; to consider the upward readjustment
of the anthracite wage scale and &ldquo;methods to abolish
the pernicious system now in vogue in the anthracite
region by which a part of the earnings of the mine workers
is taken from them by the infamous system of dockage,
and by the practice of compelling mine workers to
load more than 2240 pounds for a ton.&rdquo; The operators
disregarded the convention's invitation to a joint conference.
The men struck. The operators made concessions
but refused to deal with the union. The men
accepted the concessions and returned to work. During
the next two years they fortified their treasury and prepared
to strike again. John Mitchell had become president
of the United Mine Workers. In February, 1902,
he addressed a circular letter to the presidents of the
anthracite railroads inviting them to a joint conference.
The railroad presidents refused to have anything to do
with the union. The anthracite miners then made a
public proposal that the issues should be submitted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
arbitration of the Industrial Branch of the National Civic
Federation, of which Senator Hanna was chairman, or of
Archbishop Ireland, Bishop Potter, and one other person
to be selected by these two. But all such tentatives were
also rejected by the operators. It was about this time
that Mr. George F. Baer, president of the Philadelphia
and Reading Coal Company and of the Reading Railway
System, made his interesting declaration that &ldquo;the rights
and interests of the laboring man will be protected and
cared for, not by the labor agitators, but by the Christian
men to whom God has given the control of the property
interests of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Efforts at conference and arbitration having failed, the
anthracite miners called a strike. Only a minority of the
men had previously joined the union, but ninety men in a
hundred obeyed the strike call. The bituminous miners
were eager to declare a sympathetic strike, but they had
collective agreements in the more important fields and
their president, John Mitchell, and their secretary, William
B. Wilson, afterwards Secretary of Labor in President
Wilson's cabinet, insisted upon honoring these contracts.
Trade union discipline had grown stronger since
the days of Siney and Mitchell's counsel prevailed. The
anthracite strike dragged on throughout the summer.
Winter was approaching. President Roosevelt decided
to intervene. There was no precedent for such intervention
in the coal industry, which though basic to the industrial
life of the nation, was held sacred to the traditional
rights of private ownership and business initiative. In his
address to the miners and operators, President Roosevelt
expressed his sense of the unprecedented character of
his action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as there seemed to be a reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
hope that these matters could be adjusted between the
parties it did not seem proper for me to interfere in any
way. I disclaim any right or duty to interfere in any
way, upon legal grounds or upon any official relation that
I bear to the situation. But the urgency and the terrible
nature of the catastrophe impending, where a large portion
of our people, in the shape of a winter fuel famine,
are concerned, impel me after anxious thought to believe
that my duty requires me to use whatever influence I
personally can bring to bear to end a situation which has
become literally impossible.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In spite of his disavowal of legal authority or official
responsibility, President Roosevelt's action was publicly
regarded as the official action of the nation's chief executive.
It gave the public its first intimation of the status
of coal as that of a public utility. It stamped upon the
coal industry the character of an essential public service
which has attached to it ever since. Backed by public
opinion, which would have sustained him if he had declared
the existence of a public emergency and had taken
over the anthracite industry as the government did the
entire coal industry during the war, he was able to force
the submission of the dispute to a commission of arbitration
by whose decision both sides pledged themselves to
abide. The strike was settled. A machinery of government
was established and put into operation. As the result
of President Roosevelt's action, collective bargaining
was for the first time given public sanction not only in the
anthracite field but throughout the coal industry. For
seventeen years, and indeed, with the exception of a brief
interval in 1919, for twenty years, peace and constitutional
government prevailed not only in the anthracite
field, but, with the exception of a few districts, notably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
certain counties in West Virginia and the coking fields
subsidiary to the steel industry in Pennsylvania, Colorado,
and Alabama, throughout the bituminous fields also.</p>

<p>The structure of this government and its basic laws are
written into collective contracts, which, together with the
policies formulated by the two parties through their
national organizations, must be our guides in the quest
for an answer to the question as to how, short of the
autocratic control of the Fuel Administration, the coal
industry is to be developed into an integrated, dependably
governed, public service.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Rise of Democracy</span></h3>

<p>The historians of the growth of democratic government
in the coal industry generally date the establishment of
collective bargaining as a permanent institution from
1898, when the operators of the Central Competitive
Field&mdash;Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois&mdash;in
a joint conference with the representatives of
the United Mine Workers of America entered into an
agreement which with minor modifications was periodically
renewed from that time onward. From that year to
1922 operators and miners alike recognized the agreement
in the Central Competitive Field as basic to the
agreements in all other fields and the central competitive
conference as the necessary prelude to all other conferences.
But it was President Roosevelt and the Anthracite
Strike Commission which he appointed that lifted human
relationships within the industry out of the limbo of
frontier strife and periodic guerrilla warfare and stamped
them with the quasi-public character of a self-governing
constitutional democracy.</p>

<p>From the beginning, certain of the coal owners, notably
those in sections of West Virginia and Alabama, whose
coking coals make them economically subsidiary to the
steel industry, have held strongly to the autocratic powers
and privileges which the conception of property carried
over from the pre-revolutionary monarchical days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the king was generally recognized, <i>Dei gratia</i>, as the custodian
of the national hoard. But the Roosevelt Commission
took the stand which has increasingly won public
acceptance, that autocracy in industry is incompatible with
democracy in the political state, and that they must both
rise or fall together. Forms may change, but it may be
taken as axiomatic that if democracy is the law determining
the evolution of political civilization,&mdash;if it is the
condition of the full development of the individual personality
and the attainment of the good life and human
brotherhood,&mdash;it will survive and grow in industry as well
as in the political realm. It is from this principle of
democratic evolution, and not from the strikes and lock-outs
and barterings over wages, hours, and profits incidental
to its development, that collective bargaining and
industrial democracy derive their fundamental significance.</p>

<p>In appointing the Commission &ldquo;at the request both of
the operators and of the miners,&rdquo; President Roosevelt
asked them not only to pass upon the questions in controversy,
but also &ldquo;to establish the relations between the employers
and the wage workers in the anthracite fields on
a just and permanent basis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In arbitrating the immediate questions in dispute,&mdash;questions
of wages, hours, and working conditions,&mdash;the
Commission, even after months of hearings at which
hundreds of witnesses appeared, found themselves in the
usual predicament of arbitrators and the lay public in
such circumstances. The facts about the industry,&mdash;its
capital investment, its financial organization, its earnings
and profits, the cost of living in the district, the organization
of work in the mines, the character of the work, the
skill which it required, and its attendant hazards,&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
never been scientifically determined. Then as now these
essential facts were held to lie within the sacred province
of private business enterprise and not within the legitimate
scope of public inquiry and revelation. In instance
after instance, they found that statistics of the kind presented
were &ldquo;rather too inexact for a satisfactory basis
on which to make precise calculations.&rdquo; On the demands
of the miners and the counter-demands of the operators,
they were reluctantly constrained to adopt the usual
refuge of arbitration tribunals set up in an emergency;
they &ldquo;split the difference.&rdquo; The miners, for example,
asked for a twenty per cent increase in their rate of
wages; the Commission granted them ten per cent. Other
issues were not susceptible of such definite arbitrament,
but in general the Commission, striving to hold the scales
of justice even, followed the rule of fifty-fifty.</p>

<p>In presenting their award, the Commission, keenly
aware of the almost impossible burden which the absence
of scientific knowledge with respect to this basic industry
placed upon them, declared that &ldquo;all through their investigations
and deliberations the conviction had grown upon
them that if they could evoke and confirm a more genuine
spirit of good will, a more conciliatory disposition in the
operators and their employes in their relations toward one
another, they would do a better and more lasting work
than any which mere rulings, however wise and just, may
accomplish.&rdquo; It was with this end in view that they set
up a scheme of constitutional democratic government
within the industry.</p>

<p>Quotation is often dull, but nothing can take the place
of direct quotation in the case of a document of epoch-making
importance. By way of justifying their action
the Commission declared that &ldquo;in the days when the employer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
had but a few employes, personal acquaintance and
direct contact of the employer and employe resulted in
mutual knowledge of the surrounding conditions and the
desires of each. The development of the employers into
large corporations has rendered such personal contact and
acquaintance between the responsible employer and the
individual employe no longer possible in the old sense.
The tendency toward peace and good-fellowship which
flows out of personal acquaintance or direct contact
should not, however, be lost through this evolution of
great combinations. There seems to be no medium
through which to preserve it, so natural and efficient as
that of an organization of employes governed by rules
which represent the will of a properly constituted majority
of its members, and officered by members selected for
that purpose, and in whom authority to administer the
rules and affairs of the union and its members is vested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anthracite operators had conditioned their submission
to the award of the Commission by refusing to
be drawn into a collective agreement with the miners'
national organization, the United Mine Workers of
America. The Commission got around this technicality
by constituting the anthracite district divisions of the
union and the organized anthracite operators the two
houses of the anthracite parliament. The democratic government
which they set up is typical of the scheme of
government which now prevails through eighty per cent
of the coal industry, and which, while it is subject to the
fluctuations characteristic of all democratic institutions,
may be taken as permanent in principle.</p>

<p>Again, because of its historical importance, the language
of the Commission calls for direct quotation. The
Commission decreed: &ldquo;That any difficulty or disagreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
arising under this award, either as to interpretation or
application, or in any way growing out of the relations of
the employers and employed, which can not be settled or
adjusted by consultation between the superintendent or
manager of the mine or mines and the miner or miners
directly interested, or is of a scope too large to be so
settled or adjusted, shall be referred to a permanent joint
committee, to be called a board of conciliation, to consist
of six persons, appointed as hereinafter provided. That
is to say, if there shall be a division of the whole region
into three districts, in each of which there shall exist an
organization representing a majority of the mine workers
of such district, one of said board of conciliation shall be
appointed by each of said organizations, and three persons
shall be appointed by the operators, the operators in each
of said districts appointing one person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The board of conciliation thus constituted shall take
up and consider any question referred to it as aforesaid,
hearing both parties to the controversy, and such evidence
as may be laid before it by either party; and any
award made by a majority of such board of conciliation
shall be final and binding on all parties. If, however, the
said board is unable to decide any question submitted, or
point related thereto, that question or point shall be referred
to an umpire, to be appointed, at the request of said
board, by one of the circuit judges of the third judicial
circuit of the United States, whose decision shall be final
and binding in the premises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The membership of said board shall at all times be
kept complete, either the operators or the miners' organizations
having the right, at any time when a controversy
is not pending, to change their representation thereon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all hearings before said board the parties may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
represented by such person or persons as they may respectively
select.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No suspension of work shall take place, by lock-out
or strike, pending the adjudication of any matter so taken
up for adjustment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the date of the Commission's award to 1919,
when President Wilson created a similar commission to
avert a threatened break, the anthracite operators and
miners, who were invariably represented by the presidents
of the three district organizations of the United Mine
Workers of America, lived at peace under this constitution.</p>

<p>The machinery of constitutional government thus given
public sanction in the anthracite field is in its general
outline and provisions typical of the machinery which
through joint conference and negotiation the organized
miners and operators have worked out throughout the
greater part of the bituminous fields. The miners act
under the authority of their national convention when it
is in session and under the general direction of their
national president and executive board, acting under laws
devised by the national convention in the interval between
the national convention's biennial sessions. Within
the limitations set by the national laws of the organization,
the four thousand local unions and the twenty-seven
district unions exercise a degree of local autonomy analogous
to the local autonomy of our cities, towns, counties,
and states. In fact the entire national organization is built
up from the mine committees at the individual mines,
which, conjointly with the representative of the management
at the mine, are the courts of original jurisdiction.
As in the case of our states in relation to the federal
government, these local bodies reserve all authority that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
is not specifically delegated to the national organization
through its constitution and the action of the national
convention, the representative national congress of the
union. Unlike the President of the United States, the
president of the United Mine Workers has no power to
appoint and remove his cabinet&mdash;the National Executive
Board&mdash;but through his power over the national organizers
and the other agents of the national office, he is in a
position to control the political machinery of the organization.
By virtue of its form of organization, the miners'
union has the virtues as well as the defects of our
American political organization, defects which are the
price of self-government and the educative processes of
self-government.</p>

<p>Because of the compact nature of the anthracite field
and its domination by a small group of railroads, the
operators of this field have acted in concert for many decades.
But until 1917, the coal owners of the country
had no national organization. In that year, for the purposes
of negotiation with the federal government relative
to the controlled production and price of bituminous coal,
they organized the National Coal Association. Unlike
the miners' national organization, this Association is not
by its certificate of incorporation explicitly concerned
with the wage contract or industrial relations as such.
Its primary object is the &ldquo;encouragement and fostering
of the general welfare of the coal-mining industry&rdquo; as a
business enterprise. It is, however, acquiring many of the
functions of the miners' union. In recent controversies
it has actively assisted the local operators' associations in
their dealings with their organized employes. And like
the miners' national organization it actively concerns
itself with the protection and advancement of the interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of its members in Congress and the state legislatures.
But the immense extent of the bituminous coal fields
and the highly competitive character of the industry,
which has been artificially maintained by the Sherman
law, has prevented the compact organization of the bituminous
operators and has limited concerted action, especially
in matters affecting the labor contract, almost entirely
to local, state, and district associations. It is upon
the miners' organization that the operators largely rely
to equalize competitive conditions. For wages constitute
the largest single item of cost in coal production and it is
only through the ability of the miners' union to negotiate
on a nation-wide basis that this burden can be equalized
for the thousands of competing operators.</p>

<p>The inability of the operators to achieve a national
organization has not only contributed to the overdevelopment
of the industry with consequences that became critically
manifest during the war, but has also greatly complicated
the struggle of the miners to establish collective
negotiation and agreement on a national scale. In Illinois,
for example, there are three operators' associations which
have been organized to deal with labor. The oldest of
these is the Illinois Coal Operators' Association formed
in 1897. During a wage controversy in 1910 the operators
of the fifth and ninth Illinois districts broke away
from the parent body and formed an association of their
own. In 1914, the operators of the Springfield district
organized the independent Central Illinois Coal Operators'
Association. Diversity of mining conditions in the
various sections of the Illinois coal field and the inability
of the operators to equalize competitive costs without the
help of the miners were responsible for these secessions.
One of the objects enumerated in the constitution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Central Illinois Coal Operators' Association is &ldquo;to protect
the interest of the members of this association in the
making of district, state, and interstate contracts with the
United Mine Workers, to the end that such members
shall obtain scales, rates, prices, conditions, and <i>such differentials</i>
from the basic rates as the relative physical
and other working conditions of the mines owned by them
entitle them to.&rdquo; An identical clause appears in the constitution
of the Coal Operators' Association of the fifth
and ninth districts of Illinois. In 1910 the operators in
these two districts were paying seven cents a ton more
than other members of the parent association. They
seceded and entered into a separate agreement with the
union in the hope that the union would be able to abolish
this unfavorable differential. The union succeeded only
in reducing the differential to four cents. While these
three associations compete with one another for terms
with the miners' union within their own state, they cooperate
in their common effort to secure from the miners
terms that will place them at a competitive advantage as
against operators in other states. This rivalry among
the operators makes the diplomatic problem of the union's
national officers a very difficult one and when groups of
operators, like those in certain counties of West Virginia
and Alabama, refuse to deal with the union at all and
impose cut-rate wage scales upon their unorganized
employes as a basis for cutting the price of coal in the
limited market, the industry is thrown into confusion
bordering upon anarchy. The operators in the organized
fields hold the union responsible for its failure to organize
the anti-union fields and so to equalize competitive conditions.
Many of them decide that their only remedy is
to break with the union and through individual bargaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
with their employes when the labor market is overstocked
force down wages and working conditions to the
level of the anti-union fields. The organized miners are
thus compelled to fight for their organization and the
maintenance of their dearly won standard of living.
Strikes and lockouts temporarily take the place of the
orderly processes of joint negotiation, conciliation, and
collective agreement as in the spring of 1922.</p>

<p>The processes of conflict and cooperation through
which government in industry, as in the state, evolves, are
as truly cosmic processes as those through which the coal
measures themselves were created, with the humanly significant
difference that the processes of social evolution
are, within certain limits, controllable by the will of man.
The policy of democratic peoples and therefore of their
governments is to allow the maximum freedom of development
to government within industry compatible with
the comfort and economic security of the community as
a whole. Where the security of the community is threatened,
the government tends to intervene as President
Roosevelt did in the case of the anthracite controversy.
And while the traditional bias of government and the
law,&mdash;the bias which they inherited from the feudal society
which existed when the industrial revolution began,&mdash;favors
the owners of property to which a special sanctity
still adheres, public opinion among peoples devoted to
democracy in the political state increasingly tends to assert
itself in favor of democracy in industry, and more especially
such basic industries as the railroads and coal. It
is for this reason that it is logical to assume that the
point of view toward collective bargaining, expressed by
President Roosevelt's Commission and incorporated into
the social creeds of most of the Christian denominations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
will ultimately prevail. And since collective bargaining
and the orderly processes of government initiated by the
joint labor contracts are the historical foundations of
democracy in industry, it is also reasonable to infer that
collective bargaining will increasingly become the rule in
industrial relations.</p>

<p>But there are large issues of momentous public concern
which do not come within the scope of collective bargaining.
Rule 15 in the standard agreement between the
operators and the miners in the bituminous fields of
central Pennsylvania specifically forbids the miners to
concern themselves in any way with the problems of
management and the technical equipment and organization
of the mines. Because of the great abundance of
coal, the industry had been developed by overexpansion
and wasteful skimming rather than by the application of
scientific methods to the mining of the best coal and its
efficient utilization. Not only is one ton of coal left
irrecoverably underground for every ton brought to the
surface, but less than one-half of the economic value of
coal is utilized by our primitive methods of consumption.
In a time when it is possible to transform coal into gas
and electricity at the mine and transport its fuel and
power cheaply by pipe and wire, thirty per cent of our
entire coal production is used for transportation by steam
engines that harness up only from nine to twelve per cent
of the energy in a ton of coal in a way that will actually
pull a train&mdash;and a third of all the freight tonnage carried
by the railroads is coal. Moreover our modern chemical
industries, such as the dye industry, are based upon the
substances contained in bituminous coal, most of which
are wasted in our customary methods of consumption.
These facts impose an immense burden of needless cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
upon the consumer, and draw into the overexpanded coal
industry tens of thousands of miners in excess of efficient
requirements. The owners are therefore subject to wide
fluctuations in the price of their product, the miners are
the victims of intermittent and irregular employment
with consequent uncertainty of earnings, and the public
ultimately foots the bill, which, as has already been
pointed out, Mr. F. G. Tryon of the U. S. Geological
Survey calculates at one million dollars for each working
day paid in unofficial and needless taxation, and the
miners, by the terms of the collective agreement are explicitly
debarred from all participation in the solution of
these problems of management.</p>

<p>As a remedy, bituminous operators have proposed that
they shall be relieved of the restrictions of the Sherman
law, so that they may combine to limit production and
regulate distribution and prices as the anthracite owners
have succeeded in doing. The miners, by resolution of
their national convention, have proposed a policy of public
ownership and democratic administration, the entrusting
of the technical regulation and development of the mines
to engineers appointed by the government and the administration
of labor relations by a democratic tribunal composed
of representatives of the technical management, the
public, and the miners. The effectiveness of either policy
would be contingent upon the application to the mines and
their product of the scientific knowledge which has been
rapidly accumulating during the last decade and very little
of which is now applied to the industry. The character
of the political reconstruction of the industry, which public
necessity must sooner or later compel, will be largely
determined by the outcome of the impending technical
revolution in the production and utilization of coal.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rivals of Coal</span></h3>

<p>Until recently it has been taken for granted that there
was plenty of coal. The industrial revolution rose and
triumphed on the theory of an inexhaustible supply.
Mines were opened casually here and there and such coal
as was easy to get was taken from the reserves which
were supposed to be bottomless. And men were poured
into the mines, thousands in excess of the need. They
were as plentiful as the coal. Because of these two
things&mdash;the vast amount of coal and the cheap and abundant
man power&mdash;the coal industry came through the
industrial revolution which it created, without being
itself revolutionized.</p>

<p>Now the coal supply is large, but it is not by any means
unlimited. No one can increase it. There is no way of
manufacturing coal. The limitations of the supply were
fixed by the geographical revolution. Twenty million
years ago all the coal we have or shall have was packed
away in the ribs of the earth in seams varying from sixty
feet to the thickness of a blade of grass. It is estimated
that we still have in the world more than seven thousand
billion tons distributed as follows:</p>

<p>This seems like a vast amount which even wasteful production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
could hardly exhaust in thousands of years. But
much of the supply is of such low grade as to be inefficient
as a steam producer, much of it occurs at such deep
levels or so remote from the centers of population as to be
commercially unprofitable to mine. Mr. Floyd W. Parsons,
formerly editor of the <i>Coal Age</i>, has warned us
that &ldquo;each year now witnesses the exhaustion of a number
of high-grade coal areas. Far more mines producing
better grades of coal are being worked out than there are
new mines commencing to produce&hellip;. Operating companies
are now going over their acreage, taking out pillars
and working low-grade thin seams.&rdquo; And Mr. D. B.
Rushmore, chief engineer in the power and mining department
of the General Electric Company, calculates
that if our coal consumption were to continue to increase
at the apparently normal rate of seven per cent each year,
the life of our known reserves would be as follows:</p>

<table width="600" summary="Life of US coal reserves">
  <tr>
    <td align="left">Eastern District, which includes the most accessible and best quality of our fuel</td>

    <td align="left">Entire U. S. and Alaska, two-thirds of this being low-grade coals and lignites</td>
    <td align="right">84 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These figures are based upon the appraisals of the
U. S. Geological Survey. They include coal in veins as
shallow as fourteen inches, all coal whose ash content
does not exceed thirty per cent, and all known deposits
within six thousand feet of the surface. They are based
on the optimistic assumption that two-thirds of the coal
in the mines will be brought to the surface, a considerably
higher recovery than has hitherto been achieved. Mr.
Rushmore concludes that the evidence points unmistakably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to an approaching scarcity of high-grade coal and
increasingly higher prices.</p>

<p>One of the greatest single causes of waste and increased
prices is our antiquated system of distributing the energy
contained in coal. It is estimated that every hundred
tons of coal shipped involves the burning of ten tons in
railroad locomotives. There is no longer any technical
justification for transporting power in the enormously
bulky form of coal when it could be much more efficiently
distributed by pipe and wire in the form of gas and electricity.
Even were it not enormously inefficient, there are
definite physical limits beyond which the steam haulage
of coal in bulk cannot be increased&mdash;certain bottle necks
like that through which the Lehigh River flows, narrow
edges like that along the Susquehanna, where no more
slow puffing trains can go toiling up and down the slippery
grades, because there is no more room for them on the
tracks. Already the load upon the antiquated steam railroads
is too heavy for them to bear, so that the system of
transportation breaks down under every peak load and in
every crisis such as that induced by the war.</p>

<p>Moreover our methods of consumption are incredibly
wasteful. Mr. George Otis Smith, Director of the U. S.
Geological Survey, has prepared a chart showing that of
every two thousand pounds of coal, six hundred pounds
are lost in mining, one hundred and twenty-six pounds
are consumed at the mine and en route to the boiler room,
four hundred and forty-six pounds are lost in gases going
up the stack, fifty-one pounds are lost by radiation and
fifty-one in the ash pit, six hundred and fifty pounds are
lost in converting heat energy into mechanical energy, and
only seventy-six pounds out of the two thousand are
actually converted into productive mechanical energy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
After two hundred years of mechanical invention, we are
still stupidly content to dissipate ninety-six per cent of the
labor-saving value of coal.</p>

<p>But even if the coal supply were unlimited, if every
year a new crop grew to take the place of the one consumed,
even if it were physically possible for the railroads
to carry an ever-increasing load, the miners are not
willing to get it out on the same old basis of low wages,
high hazards, and demoralizing irregularity of employment.
Man power has changed its own status. In 1919
the wages of common labor at the mines were fixed at
seven and a half dollars a day. As wages go, this would
have meant a reasonably fair standard of living if work in
the mines had been steady. But during the last thirty
years the mines have been idle an average of ninety-three
days in every three hundred and eight working days in
the year, and during 1921 the miner was fortunate who
got as much as two days of work in the week, that is,
fifteen dollars a week and seven hundred and eighty dollars
a year. The hazards of mining have increased. The
U. S. Bureau of Mines tells us that while in 1890 the
death rate of coal miners was 2.15 for every thousand
men employed, in 1914 the rate had increased to 3.19.
In 1890 between three and four miners were killed for
every million tons mined; in 1914 between four and five
miners were killed for every million tons. Labor is no
longer content to be sacrificed in order to put an increasing
stream of cheap coal into the fire boxes of engines that
waste nine-tenths and more of their labor and so deprive
them of the possibility of the good life according to
American standards. They are taking stock and evaluating
themselves. Some of their demands, like the six-hour
day, five days a week, are socially unwise, but they represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a just protest against the demoralizing intermittency
of employment. The demand is simply an effort to spread
the actual hours of work evenly throughout the year.
Already the conditions imposed by the unions in the interest
of a reasonable standard of living act as a strong differential
against the mining of difficult seams and poor
grades of coal. They are rapidly getting into a position
where they can dictate the conditions under which they
will hazard their lives underground. And these are not
conditions which the coal industry with its competitive
overdevelopment, its load of parasite railroads, sales
companies, company-owned houses and stores, its inefficient
operating methods, and particularly its antiquated
energy-producing equipment on which it must pay heavy
interest, is prepared to meet.</p>

<p>Because the supply of coal cannot much longer meet
the cumulatively wasteful demands upon it; because the
railroad system is breaking down under the increased bulk
of coal to be transported; because the miners are increasingly
insisting that the reward of their hazardous labor
must give them a fair chance of the good life according to
American standards of living; and because the community
which must be served cannot indefinitely pay the
price of inefficiency and waste, the present order in the
coal industry is drawing to a close.</p>

<p>The technicians have seen this impending change for a
long time. Through their help the industrial revolution
might have reorganized the coal industry decades ago
under the pressure of an increasing demand for power,
if it had not been held off by new discoveries of petroleum
and natural gas. Petroleum, which had been used in a
small way in many countries for centuries, first became
an international commodity when Roumania began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
ship it in 1857. It took on great industrial importance
when the first American well, the famous Drake well in
Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, was sunk in 1859. But in 1860
the world's total recorded production was less than five
hundred and ten thousand barrels, of which five hundred
thousand barrels are credited to the United States. By
1917 the world output had risen to nearly four hundred
and fifty million barrels, of which the United States furnished
nearly four hundred million.</p>

<p>The coal and petroleum industries are closely interrelated.
Coal and petroleum are largely interchangeable as
sources of energy. Both can be used for fuel under
boilers in their crude state, although crude oil is the more
efficient; both provide an illuminating oil for use in
lamps, although kerosene is so much better than coal oil
as to have driven it out of the market; both furnish a
satisfactory fuel for the internal-combustion engine, although
benzol, a coal derivative, has not yet been recovered
in sufficient quantities to make it a competitor of
gasoline; both provide a fuel gas, although that derived
from petroleum has the greater heat value. Ton for ton,
petroleum has every advantage over coal, and there is
every reason why it should drive coal out of its preeminent
position in industry, except one&mdash;the limitations
of the supply.</p>

<p>For petroleum is far cheaper to produce, not only in
terms of money, but in terms of human effort and life.
Compare with the labor and hazard of opening and working
a coal mine Pogue and Gilbert's description of the
opening of an oil well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drilling an oil well is commonly done by means of a
heavy string of tools, suspended at the end of a cable and
given a churning motion by a walking beam rocked by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
steam engine&hellip;. The steel tools, falling under their
own weight, literally punch their way to the depth
desired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usual custom is for four men working two twelve-hour
shifts to sink a well. Their work is to keep the
engine that operates the drill running, to watch the
operation, and to stoke the engine. The only danger is
when the time has come to &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; the well. This is
done only if the oil does not flow naturally when the oil-bearing
strata are reached. The &ldquo;shooting&rdquo; consists in
dropping a &ldquo;go devil&rdquo; upon canisters of nitroglycerine
to blow out a cavity at the bottom in which oil may collect.
If the charge explodes before it reaches the bottom
of the well, it may blow back and wreck the derrick, and
the timbers and &ldquo;bull-wheel&rdquo; may fall upon the men. This
danger, which can be obviated by the simple process of
the men going away until after the charge has exploded,
is practically the only one connected with drilling for
petroleum, except for the incidental danger which all
handling of high explosives necessarily involves.</p>

<p>A well costs only about one-tenth as much per foot
of descent as a mine shaft; and it can be put down in
much quicker time. When it is once in contact with the
oil, operating expenses are trifling, for in many cases the
oil reaches the surface under natural gas pressure, and in
others it has merely to be pumped. There are not the
expenses for breaking rock, timbering, or haulage, which
are common in coal mining.</p>

<p>So that in addition to being a better fuel than coal to
burn under a steam boiler, petroleum mining is as healthful
and safe an occupation as can be well found in contrast
with the extremely dangerous work of the coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
miner, and it can be far more quickly and more cheaply
got out of the ground.</p>

<p>It has other advantages.</p>

<p>Coal, bituminous coal especially, is so bulky and so
liable to spontaneous combustion that it is difficult to
store. Petroleum, on the contrary, can be easily and
satisfactorily stored in iron tanks which, standing about
like great cheese boxes, are characteristic of the oil-producing
country. Added to the advantage of easy
storage is the much greater one of easy transportation.
Unlike coal, the crude petroleum supply of the country
makes no demand upon the railroads. Only under exceptional
circumstances and for short distances is it hauled
about in tank cars. It has its own independent system of
pipe lines, after the manner of a great water supply.
These systems connect the oil wells with the refineries,
the markets, and the seaports.</p>

<p>The pipe lines are ample to distribute the current production
of oil. It is these pipe lines that have not only
made the petroleum industry absolutely independent of
the railroads, but through the low cost of their operation
have lowered the cost of petroleum products. They have
also made it possible to establish oil refineries near the
points of consumption and have united widely separated
fields.</p>

<p>For all these reasons&mdash;because it is a more efficient fuel
under steam boilers; because it can be produced more
cheaply; because the work of mining it is easy and the
danger is slight; and because having an independent
transportation system of its own it makes no demand
on the already overburdened railroads&mdash;petroleum might
have superseded coal as the power that rules industry if
there had been enough of it. Even as it is, petroleum has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
been able to meet a large part of the demand for fuel and
so stand between the coal industry and the reorganization
hanging over it.</p>

<p>But we have been, if possible, more prodigal in our
exploitation of our petroleum resources than of coal.
There was an immediate market for all the petroleum that
could be produced. The well-owner's chief anxiety was
lest his neighbor, whose well tapped the same underground
reservoir, should get the oil out before he did.
So the exploiters of petroleum rushed on their quarry
with an avidity never equalled by the exploiters of coal.
While approximately one-half of the coal has been left
in the ground through the eagerness of the owners to beat
each other to market, from seventy to ninety per cent of
the petroleum in the various fields has been lost from
the same cause. And industry has seemed to take it for
granted that because petroleum was being produced so
rapidly, there was an unlimited supply. In 1916, many
plants shifted from coal to fuel oil, because of the inability
of the railroads to deliver coal. We have developed an
oil-burning navy and are rapidly developing an oil-burning
merchant marine. Ships and factory furnaces are
competing with the internal-combustion engines of millions
of automobiles and the hungry lamps of the countryside
for the diminishing reserves of petroleum. Already
the supply of crude petroleum is hard pressed by the
demand for fuel oil. Already approximately one-half of
the original petroleum supply of the United States is
gone. In 1918, 460,721,000 barrels were taken, while it
was estimated that 6,730,000,000 barrels remained in the
ground, and the production during the two subsequent
years was approximately 400,000,000 barrels annually.
The petroleum reserve, converting barrels into tons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
amounts to only <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> of our reserves of coal. If we
stopped mining coal tomorrow and let American petroleum
take its place, all our petroleum resources would be
exhausted in about fifteen months.</p>

<p>And even if the supply of petroleum were far less limited
than the experts estimate it to be, even if there were
enough of it to last for many decades to come, the fact
that it is practically the one lubricant of the industrial
world makes it a social crime to burn it as a substitute for
coal. Without it, every railroad wheel would run hot
and stop; the great turbines in our ships and modern
power plants move on bearings that are smothered in
petroleum oil. And for petroleum as a lubricant there is
no commercially available substitute.</p>

<p>Closely associated with petroleum and originally derived
from it, is natural gas. There is no way of telling
how great the supply of this has been in the past, how
much there is in reserve, or what the present outflow is,
because the waste of natural gas has been and is notorious.
We do know, however, that the per capita consumption
in 1915, according to the U. S. Geological Survey,
was approximately four times the consumption of artificial
gas, and seven times that of the by-product coke-oven
gas, and that its average price to the consumer was sixteen
cents a thousand cubic feet as against ninety-one
cents for artificial gas and ten cents for coke-oven gas.
About one-third of the natural gas is used for domestic
purposes, about two-thirds is used for manufacture. It is
conservatively estimated that 100,000,000 gallons of gasoline
can be recovered from it annually and it is the primary
source of the lamp black from which all the printers'
ink in present use is made. The supply of natural gas
in reserve is not calculable, but since most of the wells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
show a diminished flow, it is believed to be on the way to
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Although the supplies of oil and gas have supplemented
coal for half a century and protected the coal industry
from the same sort of economic pressure which has forced
reorganization upon most other enterprises, the time is at
hand when they can no longer do so.</p>

<p>The imaginative appeal of hydroelectric power has
led many people to hope that water-power electricity
would come to the aid of coal and possibly replace it.
But Mr. Charles P. Steinmetz, of the General Electric
Company, tells us that the total available water power of
the United States has been variously estimated at from
fifty to one hundred million horse-power, that is, from
one-sixth to one-third of the horse-power equivalent of
our present annual coal production. He has gone further
and calculated the maximum possible value of all water
power beyond which the ultimate skill of invention could
never possibly go. If every raindrop which falls anywhere
in the United States, allowing only for the amount
of water needed by agriculture and the loss due to seepage
and evaporation, were collected and all the power which
it could develop in its journey to the sea were efficiently
utilized, the resultant energy would amount to just about
the same as the total which we get out of our present coal
consumption for all purposes. Water power&mdash;hydroelectric
energy&mdash;can never replace coal.</p>

<p>The waste of both petroleum and gas has been largely
due to the unrestrained acquisitive instinct seeking quick
wealth in response to the cry of the steam engine for more
and more fuel. They were drafted into service because
they could do the work of coal and do it more efficiently.
But their diminishing supply makes it impossible for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
longer to stave off the impending technical revolution in
the coal industry. The miners are growing restive under
the evils of intermittent employment, uncertain income,
and demoralizing conditions of living. The public begins
to rebel against irregularity of supply and ruinously high
prices. The antiquated transportation system creaks and
staggers under a load which the advance of technical
science makes it unnecessary for it longer to carry.</p>

<p>All these, taken together with the still-increasing demand
for power to drive on production and pile up a
surplus on which to base an advancing civilization, are
forcing a new technical revolution upon the coal industry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Technical Revolution</span></h3>

<p>The economic surplus which the industrial revolution
of the latter eighteenth century created was the product of
a crude, extensive exploitation of our natural resources.
With the aid of the steam engine men skimmed the cream
of the mines, the forests, and the new soil of the American
continent.</p>

<p>The wasteful use of our coal, paralleling as it did our
increasing need for power, was hampering the industries
of the country even before the war. After the breaking
out of the conflict the overwhelming pressure for increased
production could not be met. In a panic we
pushed our old methods of coal exploitation further than
ever before, drew on our oil and gas supplies to the
utmost, and then in final desperation integrated the administrative
side of the coal industry through the Fuel
Administration.</p>

<p>The relief this brought was immediate, although the
chief work of the Fuel Administration was merely to
systematize and coordinate the distribution of coal so
that those who must have it would get it. For during
wartime the factories must run, and the autocratic integration
which the Fuel Administration accomplished
created a seeming abundance by keeping the factory
wheels of at least the essential industries turning.</p>

<p>But the relief was only apparent&mdash;not actual. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the tumult of the war was over and we were back in still
water, Secretary Lane announced that the enormous development
of war industries had created an almost insatiable
demand for power&mdash;a demand that was overreaching
the available supply with such rapidity that had
hostilities continued, it is certain that by 1920 we should
have been facing an extreme power shortage. Integrated
administration had done all it could but the problem
of power to advance civilization&mdash;to build up a surplus
through production&mdash;to give all men the chance of
the good life, was still unsolved. Just as the integration
by the Fuel Administration had deferred the acute power
shortage during the war, so the business depression that
followed the signing of the armistice is still holding it in
check. And yet if civilization is to go on, our multitudinous
factory wheels must turn again more swiftly and in
increasing number, our looms must weave more and more
cloth, and new cars and new ships must carry new millions
of people to and fro. As yet we know no other
material means through which to build up the good life
than these whirling wheels.</p>

<p>The technical experts have agreed that the problem
must be solved through the integration of all our sources
of fuel and power which they, like the Fuel Administration
during the war, regard as a common reservoir like
the water supply of a modern community, and through
the reduction of both coal and water power to terms of
their common denominator, electricity. As the result of
Secretary Lane's prevision of the impending power shortage,
Congress in 1921 made an appropriation for a preliminary
survey by the technical experts of the power
resources along the Atlantic seaboard from Washington
to Boston and for one hundred and fifty miles inland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
This territory has been called the &ldquo;finishing shop&rdquo; of
America. It is of irregular coast line, giving good harbors
for the shipping to carry its products overseas; its
swift streams turned the first factory wheels in America;
its mountain ranges are full of metals and easily accessible
coal; and to this region the industrially trained peoples of
Europe most naturally come. Obviously its factory
wheels must turn.</p>

<p>As a result of the survey of this region, engineers have
worked out what is called the Superpower Plan. According
to this, a giant network of wire will be woven over the
territory between the Alleghenies and the Atlantic seaboard
and charged with the very essence of power. Great
steel towers, like those that now carry the currents generated
at Niagara Falls, the Keokuk Dam on the Mississippi,
and the Roosevelt Dam at the head of Salt River
in the Arizona Desert, will stride through the valleys and
across the mountains along a two-hundred-foot right of
way. Instead of steel rails and puffing engines to convey
industrial power, there will be only towers and copper
wires. Instead of millions of tons of raw coal moving
slowly along through bottle necks in the mountains and
through congested freight yards, there will be the silent
rush of uncounted electrons hurrying to the centers of
production to do the work of man. Instead of spreading
dirt and noise and ugliness, these new carriers of cosmic
energy will be high harps for the wind.</p>

<p>According to this plan of the Superpower Commission
the main line of this new power system begins at Washington
and follows the coast through the great centers of
population&mdash;Baltimore, Wilmington, Philadelphia, Newark,
New York, New Haven, Providence, Boston, and on
up to Newburyport. Stretching away from this main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
line two principal inland lines are projected, one swinging
off at Baltimore out to Harrisburg and up the anthracite
valley to Scranton; another leaving the main line just
before it reaches New York and stretching up the Hudson
Valley to Poughkeepsie, Port Jervis, and Utica, tapping
the hydroelectric generating stations in the Adirondacks,
and connecting again through Pittsfield, Northampton,
and Worcester with the main line in Boston.
North and south cross lines mesh these secondary lines
with the main line along the coast&mdash;one through Hartford
and Waterbury to New Haven, and another from
Worcester to Providence, with a short branch line to
New Bedford. Back and forth across this network of
high-tension wires will run the power to turn the factory
wheels.</p>

<p>About nine-tenths of this power will be the developed
energy of coal. The Superpower Commission's plan
calls for the establishment of great steam-generating
plants near the mines where the coal will be used to fire
steam engines which will turn dynamos and so convert
the energy of coal into electricity and feed it to that great
harp in the wind. Steam-generating plants to supply
more distant consumers are projected at tidewater&mdash;that
is at places to which coal can be delivered by coastwise
steamers. Incidentally these tidewater plants involve a
considerable amount of coal haulage from the mines to
the seaports, and from the ports nearest the mines to the
other ports along the coast; from the lower West Virginia
fields, across the mountains, to the southern end of
Chesapeake Bay and thence by boat northward along the
coast to Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and
New Hampshire. En route this coal will be joined by
other coal from the upper West Virginia and the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Pennsylvania bituminous fields and also by coal from the
middle Pennsylvania field which will have to be freighted
through New Jersey to the Hudson ports, then again up
Long Island Sound by steamdrawn barges. While great
economies would be effected by the transformation of coal
into electric energy at the superpower stations, both at
the mines and at the tidewater ports, the plan of the
Superpower Commission still involves the necessity of
hauling millions of tons of raw coal from the mines to
seaboard. This limitation the Commission held to be
necessary, not only for the purpose of utilizing the comparatively
small plants which existing public utility companies
have already built, but because at the time their
report was made the electrical engineers had not yet perfected
means of transporting electricity for long distances
without great leakage on the way. Since the Commission's
survey was published, however, an invention has
been announced which greatly increases the distance over
which the high-voltage currents can be efficiently sent,
so that it is now feasible to transmute a much larger proportion
of coal into electricity at the mine. The plan for
practically all the tidewater generating plants can be
given up, together with the long, slow, costly process of
carrying coal to them, and that ninety per cent of the
electricity for the superpower system which is derived
from coal can be generated directly at the mine.</p>

<p>The other ten per cent according to the Commission's
plan will be hydroelectric power. Generating stations are
to be established at the rapids of the Potomac just above
Washington; along the lower reaches of the Susquehanna
in Pennsylvania and Maryland; along the upper courses
of the Delaware and the Hudson; in the Adirondacks;
and at intervals along the whole length of the Connecticut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
River. But the main dependence of the projected superpower
system is still the bituminous coal supply which it
is planned to keep at its old job of raising steam to drive
the turbine engines which will in turn drive the electric
dynamos.</p>

<p>Besides the Commission's superpower plan for the
Atlantic seaboard, other power systems have been
sketched out, one centering around Helena in southern
Illinois and designed to serve most of the Mississippi
Valley, one near the northwest coast, another in California.</p>

<p>The integration of water and coal is a long step toward
the solution of the power problem, in that it not only
brings a new force to supplement the coal supply but also
saves the coal now used by steam locomotives to haul raw
fuel to its millions of consumers. Moreover, it contemplates
the electrification of all the railroads within the
zone whose traffic is heavy enough to warrant it, and as
it is estimated that two pounds of coal applied to an electric
locomotive will do as much work as seven and one-half
to eight and one-half pounds when applied to a steam
locomotive, the amount of coal now used for transportation
will be still further reduced. Through such beginnings
as these projected superpower systems must come
the comprehensive integration of the industry.</p>

<p>But the Federal Commission's superpower plan as published
is only a beginning. It is not enough merely to
save the energy of coal, to relieve the congestion on the
freight railroads, and to provide a common-carrier system
for high-voltage electricity. There is needed also the more
intensive utilization of the fuel supply. The plan of the
Superpower Commission regards coal&mdash;bituminous coal
especially&mdash;as nothing more than fuel. The industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
revolution was built upon the power of coal to fire the
boilers in steam engines. But the use of coal for the
generation of steam only is almost the least efficient way
in which it can be utilized. From the point of view of
national economy the better utilization of what are known
as the by-product values of bituminous coal is quite as
important as the establishment of an integrated power
system.</p>

<p>For coal is much more than potential power. Bituminous
coal is the source of many of our most valuable
mineral products and yet today, of the more than 500,000,000
tons annually produced, almost all is used exclusively
for the production of power and all of its ingredients
except the heat-producing elements are wasted.
About one-twelfth of the bituminous coal&mdash;that which is
now used for the production of coke in ovens that recover
its by-product&mdash;must be excepted from this statement.
Moreover, the 90,000,000 tons of anthracite mined every
year are economically used because anthracite contains
practically nothing but carbon and ash and its direct
burning is the most efficient way in which it can be used
if its energy content is thoroughly conserved. Omitting,
then, the whole of the anthracite supply, and that bituminous
which is already properly utilized, we still have more
than 400,000,000 tons wastefully used every year&mdash;so
wastefully that not only are all its commodity values
destroyed, but its primary purpose of creating heat and
industrial power is imperfectly served. In the effective
integration of fuel and power it will become necessary to
separate the energy-producing elements in bituminous
coal&mdash;and also of the sub-bituminous coal, of lignite and
peat, of which we have reserves amounting to the billions
of tons&mdash;from those which have only a commodity value.</p>

<p>In their report made for the Smithsonian Institution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Gilbert and Pogue point out that &ldquo;there are in one ton
of good bituminous coal, fifteen hundred pounds of
smokeless fuel analogous to anthracite, ten thousand cubic
feet of gas, twenty-two pounds of ammonium sulphate,
two and one-half gallons of benzol, and nine gallons of
tar&rdquo; and that lignite gives almost as much of these commodities.
Apart from the fuel values represented by the
&ldquo;smokeless fuel analogous to anthracite&rdquo; the gas and
benzol, the ammonium sulphate, and tar have unique
values as fertilizers, and the source of those mineral
elements from which our dyes and a large part of our
modern medicines are made. The process used to extract
these commodity values is similar to that which nature
used in making anthracite, except that the volatile matter
which the geological revolution drove off into the air is
collected and utilized.</p>

<p>The gas created by the process can be delivered by pipe
lines over practically any distance to the centers of consumption,
or, with the help of the internal-combustion
engine, converted into electrical energy at the mine. Gas
as a fuel has the great advantage that it eliminates both
storage and haulage, and produces the same amount of
heat from about one-half the amount of coal, and since it
can be produced as needed all the year round it will go
far to eliminate the seasonal character of coal mining.
Moreover, wherever heat rather than light or power is
desired, gas, in the present state of technical development,
is even more economical than electricity. Under
the by-product system the present annual coal output can
be made to more than double its service in driving machinery
and in addition it can be made to contribute
heavily to our supply of fertilizers, motor fuel, and chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
products. It is estimated that the aggregate loss
resulting from the present wasteful utilization of coal is
over ten dollars a year for each inhabitant of the United
States.</p>

<p>The by-products of coal can play an important part in
the fuel industry. Where it is thoroughly integrated they
can help in financing the development of hydroelectricity
to supplement the electricity produced from coal. For
while the running expenses of a hydroelectric plant are
little more than the interest on the capital invested, the
amount of that capital is large. Also the establishment of
gas plants at the mines is a costly thing. The temptation
is to revamp and repair and reorganize the present outworn
and wasteful system rather than make large new
investments and scrap the old equipment. But in the
commercial value of the by-products from bituminous
coal lies the possibility of paying for the new power to
turn our factory wheels by the sale of dyes and fertilizer
and medicines and tar and explosives and perfumes and a
hundred other things. So it is to the chemical laboratories
that we look for the new values which may make
a superpower system financially possible just as it is to
the electrical workshop that we look for the inventions
which will integrate it into one thing.</p>

<p>But even the recovery and sale of the by-products of
coal are not all that is involved in the new way of supplying
the world with power. While gas can yield the full
fuel value of coal in a more efficient form than solid fuel,
as well as all the commodity values, if it is converted into
power through the steam engine, at least one-half of its
energy value is lost. To conserve its full value, gas must
be burned in the internal-combustion engine, the most
familiar type of which is the one we know under the hood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the automobile and the most efficient type is the Diesel
engine which has made the by-product system industrially
practical.</p>

<p>The internal-combustion engine is a relatively simple
device for transforming the energy in fuel into power
directly instead of indirectly as the steam engine does, of
turning wheels at first hand, of cutting out steam as a
middleman. It greatly enlarges the range of fuel utilization
because it can burn not only fuel gas and the lighter
oils&mdash;gasoline, benzol, and their close kin&mdash;but also fuel
alcohol, the supply of which though hitherto only slightly
developed will last as long as the sun and rain make vegetation
grow in the soil. Our future success in winning
and holding an economic surplus upon which the opportunity
for the good life and a world civilization depends,
rests almost as largely upon the internal-combustion
engine as the industrial revolution depended upon the
steam engine of Newcomen and Watt.</p>

<p>When the internal-combustion engine has been adequately
developed, and that time is near at hand, it will
be economically possible to establish the great superpower
stations at the mines, to integrate the electricity
flowing from their gas-driven dynamos with the flow
from the hydroelectric stations on the great rivers and
mountain streams, and to use the surplus gas and smokeless
coal to supply the domestic consumer during the
period of transition from our present wasteful fuel and
power system to the new system which will give us heat
and power with the turn of a button on an electric switch.</p>

<p>In our solution of the fuel problem there must be an
extension of such work as that of the Fuel Administration
which integrated the administrative side of the industry
as by a man in a high tower with all the resources and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
needs of the country spread beneath him. He must see
all the sources of power as in a common reservoir&mdash;all
the coal and oil and gas and water power&mdash;all the fuel
alcohol and those subtle forces within the material atoms
themselves which scientists dream of forcing to do the
work of man. He must sort and deliver power to fill the
need, this in the form of oil or gas sent through its own
pipe line; this still in the bulky form of coal or coke by
rail or water to those few industries which can take no
substitute; and more and more of it transmuted into electricity
and poured along the singing wires, or later perhaps
through the pathways of the air itself, to turn the
wheels of industry.</p>

<p>And in addition to the actual pooling of the power
resources of the country, there must come their intensive
and economical use&mdash;economical by more standards than
that of money alone&mdash;so that the miner who blasts the
coal from the face, the man who sinks the oil well or runs
the internal-combustion engine or strings the electric
wires, will get in return for the thousands of tons of coal
he has mined or the kilowatt hours he has generated from
his dynamo, the material basis of the good life.</p>

<p>This integrated industry of which the mining of coal,
the projected superpower systems, the pumping of oil,
the development of water power, and the organization and
training of those who produce or consume power are
essential parts, is the inevitable result of the development
that has gone before. Just as the industrial revolution
had its beginnings in the coordination of the steam engine,
the coal mines, and the factory machinery, and its
incentive in the drive of the acquisitive instinct to make
existence possible; so this new industrial advance, the
integration of the power that drives industry, is the logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
result of the development of long-distance electric transmission,
the intense utilization of the fuel supply, and the
invention of the internal-combustion engine, and it may
result not only in making existence possible but in making
life good.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Strait Gate</span></h3>

<p>Since the days when the cosmic energy of coal was first
harnessed to the looms of England, mechanical contrivances
of almost miraculous ingenuity have followed one
another in such rapid succession that men have come to
place undue reliance upon machinery for the solution of
the difficult human problems that impede progress toward
the good life and a worthy civilization. Just as the earlier
generations failed in the spiritual preparedness necessary
to the conversion of the technical triumphs of Newcomen
and Watt, Fulton and Stephenson, and a host of others
to the higher ends of civilization, so our generation shows
a similar disposition to rely upon the wonder workers of
mechanical science to save us from the disastrous consequences
of muddling along in the field of human relations
whether in industry, in the nation, or among the nations.
But the good life is not to be won by mechanical invention
alone. One of the outstanding lessons of the World
War was that great inventions in the realm of the physical
and chemical sciences may be destructive of the very
civilization which it is their higher mission to serve. Unless
we have the spiritual capacity to make the technique
of science obedient to the commandment to love our
neighbor as ourselves, superpower systems, high-voltage
transmission, the internal-combustion engine, may again
intensify the exploitation of man by man, the clash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
groups for power, the brutality of international wars for
possession.</p>

<p>We men and women of the twentieth century have
developed a complacent habit of priding ourselves upon
our scientific open-mindedness, our respect for facts, our
eagerness to accept the revelations of authentic scientific
investigation and experiment. As we mount into the
clouds on the wings of the aeroplane or catch the voice of
the radio operator out of ethereal space, we have a tremendous
sense of intellectual emancipation, a thrill of
escape from ancient bigotries and superstitions. There is
some warrant for this self-congratulatory attitude in so
far as it relates to the physical sciences. We have reason
to be proud that we have banished the primitive fears
that led an earlier age to persecute men like Galileo for
telling the truth with respect to the place of the earth in
the stellar universe. We are sufficiently emancipated to
know that the inventors of the dynamo, the turbine
engine, the spectroscope, wireless telegraphy, and high-voltage
electrical transmission are not guilty of heresy.
When Steinmetz forges a thunderbolt and sends it crashing
across his laboratory, we do not burn him for witchcraft.
The inquirers into the nature of the atom, the
structure of the cerebral ganglia, or the chemical composition
of the nebulae in the Milky Way are free from
medieval taboos.</p>

<p>But unfortunately we have not developed an equally
enlightened attitude toward the inquirers into the nature
of human relations in politics or industry, or toward those
who would apply the experimental method to the development
and scientific reconstruction of industrial or political
government. Terms like <i>trusts</i>, <i>the money power</i>, <i>trade
unions</i>, <i>industrial autocracy</i>, <i>collective bargaining</i>, <i>socialism</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<i>bolshevism</i>, <i>private monopoly</i>, <i>public ownership</i>, stir
all our ancient fears, resentments, and hates. Men may
be unorthodox in the physical sciences; we are growing
tolerant of unorthodoxy in religious opinion. But unorthodoxy
in the realm of politics is still frowned upon.
We still imprison men for their political and economic
opinions when they challenge the finality of accepted
institutions and especially when they advocate the fundamental
reconstruction of accepted forms of political and
economic government. Yet it is quite as true in the realm
of human relations, as in that of the physical sciences, that
the truth and the truth only can make us free. Human
brotherhood can be achieved only through human understanding.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace to say that the vigorous growth
of democracy depends upon education. But much repetition
has dulled the vital implications of the assertion. We
tend to forget that a democracy that permits essential
knowledge to be withheld from general circulation digs
its own grave; that while men talk of emancipation and
freedom, ignorance may forge chains for their enslavement.
When any group within the community is permitted
to treat facts essential to the development of right
human relations as &ldquo;trade secrets,&rdquo; education itself becomes
stereotyped and sterile. Text-books and &ldquo;lessons&rdquo;
become spiritually and intellectually empty, like the
prayers which certain Eastern cults pin to wheels that
spin idly in the wind.</p>

<p>The authentic prophets of democracy have constantly
striven to keep the channels of popular education free
from the clogging muck of selfishness, superstition, and
prejudice. They have had faith in the essential justice
and ultimate wisdom of informed public opinion. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
men have appeared in government, among the coal
owners, among the miners, who are the commoners of
the coal industry.</p>

<p>In 1914 the coal operators of Illinois and Indiana issued
a <i>Statement of Facts</i> for the enlightenment of the Government
and the people. The normal state of the coal
industry, they declared, was such as to &ldquo;endanger the
lives of the miners, waste the coal reserves, and deprive
the operators of any hope of profit.&rdquo; They therefore
appealed for &ldquo;appropriate and definite governmental control&rdquo;
to the extent &ldquo;at least of permitting all their activities
to be known to the public.&rdquo; They thus approved of
the action of Congress in creating the Federal Trade Commission
&ldquo;to gather and compile information concerning,
and to investigate from time to time the organization,
business, conduct, practices, and management of any corporation
engaged in commerce&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;and to make public
from time to time such portions of the information
obtained by it, except trade secrets and names of customers,
as it shall deem expedient in the public interest.&rdquo;
The coal operators went further than Congress since they
made no reservations with respect to trade secrets. But
after the armistice, the organized operators of the nation,
through one of their members, secured an injunction restraining
the Federal Trade Commission from prosecuting
its work of investigation and publicity, the effect of
which was to render the Federal Trade Commission Act
null and void so far as the education of the public with
respect to the coal industry was concerned. In the language
of a senator, this action &ldquo;tied the Government's
hands and poked out its eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a view to remedying certain of the major evils
that interfered with the service of the coal industry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the nation, Senators Calder, Frelinghuysen, and Kenyon
introduced bills and conducted public hearings. They had
concluded that what Congress and the public needed to
know if they were to legislate fairly and intelligently was
the full truth about &ldquo;ownership, production, distribution,
stocks, investments, costs, sales, margins, and profits in
the coal industry and trade.&rdquo; But in 1921, the organized
operators of the country, feeling that they could conduct
the industry most successfully without governmental
supervision or the scrutiny of informed public opinion,
opposed all attempts at legislation designed to accomplish
the precise ends which in 1914 the operators of Illinois
and Indiana regarded as essential to the best interests of
all concerned. In reviewing the history of the efforts
which he and his colleagues had made to get at and publish
the facts, Senator Frelinghuysen reported to Congress
that &ldquo;though we made every concession that we felt
justified in making, we find, after two years of conference
and the price of coal still high, that practically all of these
operators, organized and unorganized, are bitterly opposing
the principle of these two bills&mdash;first, the season
freight rate bill, and second the bill &lsquo;to aid in stabilizing
the coal industry&rsquo;&mdash;and have organized an elaborate
propaganda with a view to bringing about their defeat&hellip;.
The National Coal Association has been the
chief defender of the coal trade since I became interested
in the subject&hellip;. For a time I looked upon the men of
this organization as fair and reasonable and I sympathized
with their demand that the coal trade be permitted
to work out its own salvation without Government interference,
provided full statistics were obtainable regarding
cost of production, transportation, and delivery to the
humblest consumer. For a time they seemed willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
concede this. But I am finally and reluctantly convinced
that my hope in that direction has always been a delusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After devoting two years to a vain attempt to get at
&ldquo;full statistics,&rdquo; Senator Frelinghuysen lost patience with
the operators. But he forgot that many of their leaders
still sincerely adhere to Mr. Baer's faith that God has entrusted
the interests of the community to the owners of
property and that congressional interference, even when
limited to the ascertainment of statistics, is subversive not
only of the status of the owners as trustees of the nation's
fuel resources, but also of the public interest itself. This
conviction of the operators is a fact that must be weighed
without impatience like any fact in chemistry or physics.</p>

<p>The position of many labor leaders is fundamentally the
same as that of the operators. They have the traditional
fear of the autocratic power which they believe to be
inherent in the state. Like the operators, they are convinced
that the public interest is best served when each
and all of the groups within industry are left free to pursue
their special interests with utmost aggressiveness, on
the theory that the clash of many selfishnesses results, as
by a law of nature, in the neutralization of selfishness and
its conversion into public advantage. It is utopian folly,
they say, to attempt to change &ldquo;human nature,&rdquo; the dominant
characteristic of which they hold to be the acquisitive
instinct, and equally vain to attempt to modify the
natural operation of the &ldquo;law of supply and demand,&rdquo;
which, in their judgment, transcends the &ldquo;idealistic&rdquo; law
of service. They agree that it is unfortunate that this
should be so, but since it is so, does it not behoove practical
men to act accordingly? There are many men of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
mind among the leaders and rank and file of the miners,
as well as among the operators.</p>

<p>But the creative impulse back of the organized labor
movement is by virtue of necessity the democratic impulse,
and where the democratic impulse is vigorous it
feeds upon the consciousness of kind whose principal
channel of growth is knowledge. In their national convention,
held in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1919, the miners
adopted a resolution calling upon the Government,
&ldquo;through Act of Congress, to acquire title to the coal
properties within the United States now owned by private
interests; by purchasing said properties at a figure representing
the actual valuation of said properties, as determined
upon investigation by accredited agents of the
federal Government.&rdquo; They asked that &ldquo;the coal mining
industry be operated by the federal Government and that
the miners be given equal representation upon such councils
or commissions as may be delegated the authority to
administer the affairs of the coal mining industry&hellip;.&rdquo;
The stated object of the resolution was to secure the
operation of the industry &ldquo;in the interest of, and for the
use and comfort of all of the people of the commonwealth&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;to prevent the profligate waste that is
taking place under private ownership of these resources
by having the Government take such steps as may be
necessary providing for the nationalization of the coal
mining industry of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the relative merits of the policy of national
ownership as advocated by the United Mine Workers of
America, and the policy of free competition and unrestrained
private initiative advocated by the organized
operators, it is for the informed public ultimately to
judge. For two years, the miners' nationalization resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
stood as the expression of a more or less vague
aspiration, a more or less vague faith that public ownership
would check overdevelopment and so eliminate the
humanly demoralizing effects of intermittent production
and irregularity of employment. Nationalization, the
miners believed, would go far to correct the disastrous
moral and physical effects of a situation which on an
average of ninety-three days in each working year, deprives
them of the opportunity to work.</p>

<p>At their next national convention, held in Indianapolis
in 1921, they themselves recognized the controversial
nature of their nationalization policy. So they moved to
less debatable ground. They created a Nationalization
Research Committee to get at and secure the publication
of facts. In his first public address as chairman of this
Nationalization Research Committee, Mr. John Brophy,
president of the organized miners in district No. 2, Central
Pennsylvania, instead of dogmatizing about the
miners' policy of public ownership and democratic administration
as the infallible remedy for the evils of the coal
industry, appealed to the public, the operators, and the
miners &ldquo;to stop theoretical squabbling and cooperate with
us in making all facts about the industry available to the
public. We believe in intelligently planned industry. We
believe that the only method for the intelligent organization
of the industry is nationalization. The employers
disagree. In order to arrive at a decision we ask them to
submit the facts to the American people, the only jury
that has a right to pass judgment on the case&hellip;. We
ask immediate legislation for centralized, continuous, and
compulsory fact-finding in the coal industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A democracy that acquiesces in its own ignorance of
the elementary facts respecting an industry upon which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
not only its own economic life, but also the economic life
and civilized progress of the entire world so largely depends,
betrays the high privilege and responsibility of a
self-governing citizenship. Today neither the public nor
the Government knows whether the coal industry is fairly
capitalized, what the extent and value of the coal reserves
are, whether depreciation and depletion charges are reasonable,
or what are the profits and losses of the industry.
Nobody knows whether the prices which the consumer is
required to pay are fair and reasonable. Nobody knows
precisely what the preventable wastes of the industry are.
The annual wages of the miners are not subject to precise
statistical statement, nor does anyone know the number
of hours the miners work when the mines are in operation
or the number of hours they are given opportunity to
work. The statements we have are for the most part
large averages based upon inductions from small cross-sections
of the industry. The working conditions of the
miners, the technical state of the organization of work
underground, the cost of living at the more than eleven
thousand mines, remain in the foggy realm of guesswork,
estimate, and speculation. In the face of conditions
which, as the operators of Illinois and Indiana stated in
1914, &ldquo;endanger the lives of the miners, waste the coal
reserves, and deprive the operators of any hope of profit,&rdquo;
the people, like the people's government, are ignorantly
helpless. In the absence of essential information, the public
especially at times of controversy within the industry
is left to the mercy of prejudiced and partisan propaganda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is plain folly,&rdquo; Dr. Garfield, formerly
head of the Fuel Administration, testified before the
Senate Committee on Manufactures, &ldquo;not to provide for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
continuous finding of the facts as to the cost of production,
as to the stocks of coal on hand, as to the working
conditions in the mines, and as to the cost of living&hellip;.
We cannot get along as a Government or as an industry,
whether you think of it from the standpoint of the operators
or mine workers, without knowing the facts, and the
public is also vitally interested in these facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The U. S. Geological Survey has in the past issued:</p>

<p>1. Annual report on the production of coal by counties
and by producing fields. 2. Annual report on the
movement of coal, showing the state or locality to which
coal produced in each district is shipped; and the origin,
by producing fields, of the coal consumed in each state or
locality. 3. Current reports at frequent intervals, showing
production of coal, operating conditions at the mines,
and the movement of coal by rail and by water to various
consuming districts. 4. Occasional reports on stocks of
coal in the hands of representative consumers. 5. Annual
reports on consumption by the larger users. 6. Special
reports.</p>

<p>But while the methods to be used in these reports have
been worked out, not all of them are being carried on permanently,
the reason being lack of funds. The latest detailed
annual report on the movement of coal is for 1918,
and it is uncertain when another can be prepared. The
current reports are inadequate and the reports on stocks
and consumption are issued only at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>Even the annual reports of production leave untouched
many subjects of vital importance. We have no quantitative
information, on a national scale, as to the amount
of coal cleaned; the amount of mine-run, slack, and prepared
sizes produced; the mechanical equipment of the
mines; the depth of the coal workings; the distance the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
miner must traverse from mine mouth to working face;
the dip of the coal seam; the tonnage produced by long-wall
or room-and-pillar methods; the quantity of coal in
the ground lost to the nation each year, in the roof, in
pillars, because of squeezes; or the quantity lost in thin
seams not now minable which are broken and fractured
by the mining of lower seams. We do not know accurately
how fast electrical haulage is replacing animal
haulage underground, what progress the loading machine
is making in relieving human backs of the labor of
shoveling coal into cars. Of course, any operator and
any miner knows of these things in a general way in his
own locality, but such scattered, hazy, local knowledge
will not suffice. We must have accurate information,
national in scope.</p>

<p>In the realm of the financing of coal companies the
ignorance of the public is almost complete. We do not
know the capital value of the coal deposits, nor the degree
of concentration and control of ownership of mines or
mineral. We do not even know who owns the coal beds.
There is no list of the landholding companies who as
landlords absorb in many districts the economic rent paid
by the mines working favorable seams. We do not know
the prevailing royalty rates, we do not know whether or
not there is a soft-coal trust. The most basic of our
American industries moves in fog by day and blackness
by night.</p>

<p>The social creeds of the Christian churches will remain
the expressions of vague aspirations until they are supplemented
by the knowledge essential to their concrete
definition. Men and women who profess allegiance to
the Great Commandments of Jesus have come to realize
that the Kingdom of God on Earth, the Brotherhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Man, cannot be built by fiat or verbal proclamation. The
building of a worthy civilization is as definitely an engineering
enterprise as the building of the Panama Canal.
It demands a scientific procedure and a patient devotion
as thoroughgoing as that which during the past two hundred
years has gone into the development of the steam
engine, the aeroplane, or high-tension electric transmission.
The theory of nationalization, like the theory of
collective bargaining and the traditional theory of progress
by free competition, must each be tested, as the
existing social and industrial order must be tested, in the
light of painfully ascertained facts, and in terms of their
effect upon the individual personality.</p>

<p>For it is only in the light of the truth that we shall be
able to build a civilization in which the individual personality
may find full fruition. It is only by the aid of
knowledge and human understanding that we shall be
able to resolve the drama of civilization into a victory of
the consciousness of kind over the warfaring acquisitive
instinct. It is only by making the technique of science
obedient to the Great Commandments of Jesus that we
shall be able to build a civilization worthy of a world that
moves through infinite space with the sun and the marching
stars.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
